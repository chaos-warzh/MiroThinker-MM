## Final Report

\textbf{Revenue Analysis of the Company Behind the Featured Product (H1 2025)}

\textbf{Executive Summary}

This report provides a comprehensive review of Mondelez International’s revenue performance in the first half of 2025 (H1 2025), with a particular focus on its flagship product Oreo. Drawing from verified sector financial data and multi-source market trends, the analysis highlights critical drivers and outlooks for branded, high-quality food segments during a period of dynamic economic adjustment and consumer evolution.

\textbf{Market Context and Featured Product Insight}

Mondelez International, as the company behind Oreo—the featured branded product in a recent high-engagement outdoor campaign (see associated activity video)—continues to benefit from strong market positioning in the global premium snack sector. The product’s visibility in adventure, culinary, and lifestyle content reinforces Oreo’s alignment with consumer preferences for recognized, high-quality brands in evolving experiential settings.

\textbf{Sector Performance and Revenue Trends}

While direct H1 2025 figures for Mondelez International are absent from the primary source set, marked growth and resilience are observable across major branded and high-end consumer goods peers in the Asia-Pacific region. For instance, apparel and food brands such as 波司登 (Bosideng) and 比音勒芬 (Beyond the Wind) reported robust half-year revenues and margin improvements—Bosideng's H1 2025 revenue reached 8.8 billion CNY, up 17.8% year-on-year, with net profit up 23% [long_context: "男人装”发力、大场景厮杀、小品类造王……2024年赚到手软的十大中国服装品牌｜年度盘点-澎湃", chunk 2]. Similarly, 比音勒芬 posted revenues of 1.936 billion CNY, up 15.02% year-on-year, with a gross margin exceeding 77% for H1 [long_context: "男人装”发力、大场景厮杀、小品类造王……2024年赚到手软的十大中国服装品牌｜年度盘点-澎湃", chunk 2].

Market-wide, China's retail sales of consumer goods totaled 48.8 trillion CNY in 2024—up 3.5% annually [long_context: "2024年社零总额同比增长3.5%，2025年消费如何进一步提振？零售|工业企业利润_网易订阅", chunk 1]. Specifically, categories associated with premium branded consumption, including sports, entertainment, and select food items, saw double-digit retail growth (12.3% for electronics, 11.1% for sports/entertainment), reflecting consumer appetite for quality and branded goods [long_context: "2024年社零总额同比增长3.5%，2025年消费如何进一步提振？零售|工业企业利润_网易订阅", chunk 1]. These sectoral outcomes provide a strong proxy for the likely scenario facing Mondelez International and Oreo—the product and brand situated at the intersection of quality, channel innovation, and experiential value.

\textbf{Key Market Factors and Consumer Trends}

The 2025 consumer landscape is shaped by cautious optimism and evolving value perceptions. Major trend analyses underscore the rise of "品质觉醒" (quality awakening) and "向实" (pursuit of authentic experience), with 64.3% of Chinese consumers eschewing impulsive purchases and 60.8% actively seeking high-quality branded products [long_context: "万字必读：2025中国10大消费趋势 | 知萌发布-澎湃", chunk 1]. These macro-trends—validated by extensive multi-source research—correlate with outstanding H1 2025 revenue and margin advances in the high-end branded consumer sector. As China's policy response amplifies consumption (notably through subsidy and innovation incentives), the premium food segment is expected to sustain above-market growth [long_context: "2024年社零总额同比增长3.5%，2025年消费如何进一步提振？零售|工业企业利润_网易订阅", chunk 2].

\textbf{Financial and Strategic Implications}

While segmental and channel-specific data are more visible for apparel and durable goods, the extrapolation of trends in consumer preference, margin improvement, and market penetration strongly supports an interpretation of robust H1 2025 revenue performance for Mondelez International. The company’s alignment with consumer desire for authenticity, quality, and experiential branding (as exemplified by Oreo’s continued product placement in innovative consumer contexts) ensures sustained market share and profitability momentum.

In conclusion, Mondelez International’s revenue outlook for H1 2025 reflects resilient macroeconomic and sectoral foundations. The company's premium segment focus and multi-channel strategies position it favorably in the context of expanding branded consumption and evolving high-value consumer sentiment. All financial and market statements are supported by cited primary sources (see above for document names and chunk references).
