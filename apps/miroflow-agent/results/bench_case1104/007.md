## Final Report

\textbf{Current Research Landscape and Trends in This Field}

\textbf{Introduction}

The accelerated development of browsing agents and web-based question answering (QA) systems has catalyzed both methodological innovation and the creation of increasingly robust evaluation benchmarks. Recent benchmarks such as BrowseComp, ReportBench, and GAIA reflect a critical shift toward assessing agents on complex, multi-hop queries and real-world search scenarios—moving beyond earlier saturated benchmarks that primarily measured isolated factual retrieval [Context-1][Context-2][RAG-3].

\textbf{Current Research Landscape}

Three benchmarks have defined the field’s research contours. First, BrowseComp, introduced by Wei et al. (2025), presents 1266 hyper-challenging queries to measure agents’ ability to persistently navigate the internet in search of deeply entangled, hard-to-find information. Notably, less than 2\% accuracy was achieved by standard models such as GPT-4o and GPT-4.5, while the purpose-built DeepResearch agent attained a breakthrough with 51.5\% accuracy [Doc: 007paper.pdf][RAG-3][Context-1][Context-7]. Key properties of this benchmark include "reverse-engineering" question design, calibration of model confidence, and scaling agent performance as a function of available compute and parallel search efforts [Doc: 007paper.pdf][RAG-4].

Second, ReportBench establishes a systematic framework for evaluating AI as academic research assistants, using high-quality, peer-reviewed review papers as reference standards. The evaluation emphasizes citation accuracy, overlap with expert-selected literature, and factual validation; DeepResearch averaged 10 citations per report with 38.5\% overlap, outperforming competitors [Context-2][Context-5][Context-9][RAG-1]. This approach highlights reliability, quality inspection, and the dangers of over-citation and factual error propagation—problems still extant in current AI systems [RAG-2].

GAIA, in turn, distinguishes itself as a benchmark focused on agent robustness. Instead of targeting intelligence puzzles, GAIA evaluates day-to-day real-world tasks that are simple for humans but difficult for agents (e.g., reliable tool use, multi-step task execution, accurate information extraction from files and web sources) [Context-8][Context-10]. Results indicate a stark performance gap: humans achieve 92\% task completion versus 15\% for top agents (GPT-4 with plugins), exposing vulnerabilities in current agent designs [Context-10].

\textbf{Major Findings}

Collectively, these benchmarks reveal persistent challenges and highlight critical research breakthroughs. First, agents must integrate persistent, structured reasoning with advanced tool use to approach human-level browsing performance [Context-1][Context-4][RAG-3][Context-7]. DeepResearch’s ability to synthesize information, adapt search strategies, and accurately self-calibrate exemplifies the current technical apex, yet even its best efforts struggle with ambiguous or highly entangled queries [Doc: 007paper.pdf][RAG-4].

Second, validation frameworks such as ReportBench and evaluation metrics from GAIA push for citation trustworthiness, factuality, and real-world task generalization. Over-citation, factual error rates, and poor calibration of confidence remain areas requiring targeted research [Context-2][Context-5][RAG-2]. The importance of scalable, high-quality, and resistance-to-contamination benchmarks is repeatedly emphasized as a community priority [Context-8][Context-10].

\textbf{Future Research Directions}

Recent developments and industry commentary consistently advocate several research directions. Key among them are: (1) combining advanced inference with robust browsing and tool-based search; (2) optimizing for reliability and valid confidence calibration, especially in ambiguous or high-stakes settings; (3) extending benchmarks to include multilinguality and cross-cultural scenarios, addressing the current English-centric bias [Context-10]; (4) improving real-time adaptation, usability, and ethical compliance mechanisms [Context-3][Context-6]; and (5) developing scalable, verifiable evaluation processes that resist data pollution and support continuous agent improvement in real-world contexts [Context-8][Context-5].

Market projections and expert analyses suggest that, as demand for robust information retrieval grows, the sophistication and reliability of browsing agents will define competitive advantage in both research and enterprise environments [Context-6]. The open-source nature of benchmarks like BrowseComp is expected to drive rapid methodological progress, encourage reproducibility, and enhance aggregate agent trustworthiness [Doc: 007paper.pdf][RAG-3].
