## Query

Assume you are a nutrition science researcher preparing an analytical report for a food and health journal. Based on the materials I provide, please write a report titled 'Nutritional Value and Preparation Methods of the Featured Dish'. The report should analyze the food’s nutritional composition, health benefits, and detailed preparation process.

Requirements:
1. Combine provided document data with relevant scientific sources when necessary.
2. Cite all factual statements with document names and exact references.
3. Maintain a precise and academic tone typical of nutrition research papers.
4. The report should be between 500 and 600 words.

## Final Report

\textbf{Nutritional Value and Preparation Methods of the Featured Dish}

\textbf{Introduction} \\
The featured dish, identified through multi-modal analysis as Qing Jiao Rou Si (青椒肉丝)—Chinese stir-fried pork with green peppers—is a classic, nutritionally robust staple of Chinese cuisine [Image: 004food.JPG]. This report provides a systematic evaluation of its nutritional composition, health benefits, and detailed preparation methods, integrating data from primary document sources and supporting scientific literature.

\textbf{1. Nutritional Composition} \\
The principal ingredients of Qing Jiao Rou Si are lean pork and green bell peppers, occasionally supplemented by red chili peppers and garlic [Image: 004food.JPG]. Pork serves as the main protein source, offering approximately 20 g protein per 100 g. Notably, lean pork supplies all essential amino acids, high bioavailable heme iron, and substantial quantities of B vitamins—particularly B1 (thiamine), B6, and B12—crucial for metabolic and neurological health. Pork also contains dietary zinc and selenium, supporting immune function and antioxidative capacity [long_context: "猪肉的营养价值及其美味烹饪方法-今日头条", chunk 1]. Selection of lean cuts, such as loin, minimizes saturated fat while favoring beneficial monounsaturated fats.

Green bell peppers constitute the dish’s core vegetable component. They are remarkably rich in vitamin C, at 70–150 mg per 100 g—surpassing oranges and tomatoes—plus dietary fiber, potassium, and magnesium. Bell peppers also provide B vitamins and capsaicin, which contribute antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties [long_context: "青椒：夏季清爽的维C之王，助你减脂又健康！-搜狐", chunk 0]; [long_context: "虎皮尖椒，素食也能这么香辣下饭！", chunk 0]. Garlic and chili peppers impart additional phytonutrients and flavor complexity [Image: 004food.JPG]. The dish, when accompanied by white rice and clear soup, forms a meal with balanced macronutrients [Image: 004food.JPG].

\textbf{2. Health Benefits} \\
Qing Jiao Rou Si delivers significant health benefits stemming from its nutrient synergy. The combined intake of high-quality pork protein and green pepper vitamin C fosters efficient muscle repair, collagen synthesis, and enhanced immune defense [long_context: "青椒：夏季清爽的维C之王，助你减脂又健康！-搜狐", chunk 1]; [long_context: "虎皮尖椒，素食也能这么香辣下饭！", chunk 0]. Pork’s iron content helps prevent anemia, while B vitamins and zinc support neurological, metabolic, and reproductive functions [long_context: "猪肉的营养价值及其美味烹饪方法-今日头条", chunk 1]. The dietary fiber and capsaicin in peppers aid digestion, increase satiety, and offer protection against cardiovascular disease through vasodilation and reduced inflammation [long_context: "辣椒不是只会辣！3 大功效+3 种营养，这篇帮你把辣椒吃明白", chunk 0]; [long_context: "辣椒炒肉—夏日餐桌的开胃神器", chunk 0]. The low-fat, rapid stir-frying method preserves both vitamin C and protein digestibility, making it highly suitable for balanced, energizing meals [long_context: "青椒：夏季清爽的维C之王，助你减脂又健康！-搜狐", chunk 1].

\textbf{3. Preparation Process} \\
Evidence from culinary texts and documented recipes confirms an optimal preparation process to preserve nutritional value and achieve desirable texture [long_context: "四种辣椒炒肉的做法_五花肉_备用_瘦肉", chunk 3, 0]; [long_context: "青椒：夏季清爽的维C之王，助你减脂又健康！-搜狐", chunk 1]:

1. \textit{Ingredient Selection}: Choose fresh green bell peppers, lean pork (typically loin or tenderloin), garlic, and optionally red chili [Image: 004food.JPG].
2. \textit{Preparation}: Slice pork thinly against the grain to ensure tenderness; marinate briefly in starch (e.g., sweet potato starch), soy sauce, and oil. Cut peppers into strips or diamond shapes, removing seeds and white pith for optimal texture and nutrient retention [long_context: "四种辣椒炒肉的做法_五花肉_备用_瘦肉", chunk 3].
3. \textit{Cooking}: Heat wok with a small amount of oil, sauté garlic until fragrant, quickly stir-fry pork slices until just colored, then add bell peppers. Use high heat and rapid tossing for approximately 20 seconds; this method maximizes retention of vitamin C and pepper aroma [long_context: "青椒：夏季清爽的维C之王，助你减脂又健康！-搜狐", chunk 1].
4. \textit{Seasoning}: Add salt, light soy sauce, and, if desired, a small amount of mild chili or other low-sodium condiments. Serve immediately with steamed rice and light broth [Image: 004food.JPG].

\textbf{Conclusion} \\
Qing Jiao Rou Si exemplifies nutrient-dense, healthful Chinese cuisine. The dish harmonizes lean protein and vitamin-packed vegetables with culinary methods that reinforce both flavor and nutritional integrity. Its preparation is rapid and accessible, supporting routine dietary diversity and balanced energy intake. Scientific and culinary evidence confirm its value as an exemplary, health-promoting meal option [long_context: "青椒：夏季清爽的维C之王，助你减脂又健康！-搜狐", chunk 0, 1]; [long_context: "虎皮尖椒，素食也能这么香辣下饭！", chunk 0]; [long_context: "猪肉的营养价值及其美味烹饪方法-今日头条", chunk 1]; [long_context: "四种辣椒炒肉的做法_五花肉_备用_瘦肉", chunk 3, 0]; [long_context: "辣椒不是只会辣！3 大功效+3 种营养，这篇帮你把辣椒吃明白", chunk 0]; [long_context: "辣椒炒肉—夏日餐桌的开胃神器", chunk 0].
