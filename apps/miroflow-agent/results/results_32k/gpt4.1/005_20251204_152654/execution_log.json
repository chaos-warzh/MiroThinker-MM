Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y.

Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_32k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_32k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 664.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

It does not perform vague or speculative subtasks. \nArgs: \n\tsubtask: the subtask to be performed. \nReturns: \n\tthe result of the subtask. \nInput JSON schema: {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'subtask': {'title': 'Subtask', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['subtask'], 'title': 'search_and_browseArguments'}\n\n# General Objective\n\nYou accomplish a given task iteratively, breaking it down into clear steps and working through them methodically.\n\n## Task Strategy\n\n1. Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, the user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Thorough Analysis Requirement**:\n- For complex tasks involving document analysis, literature review, or report generation, you MUST work through **at least 7-8 turns** of analysis before producing the final answer.\n- Do NOT rush to conclusions after only 2-3 turns. Take time to:\n  - Explore different aspects of the source materials\n  - Perform multiple RAG searches with different keywords\n  - Cross-reference information from different sources\n  - Verify and validate findings\n  - Build a comprehensive understanding before synthesizing\n- Each turn should focus on a specific aspect or sub-goal\n- Only produce the final report after thorough multi-turn exploration\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. Each step must involve a single tool call, unless the task is already solved. \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, extract and summarize any partial information, patterns, constraints, or keywords that can help guide future steps.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. Do not include tool results in your response — the user will provide them.\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are a task-solving agent that uses tools step-by-step to answer the user's question. Your goal is to provide complete, accurate and well-reasoned answers using additional tools.\n\n",

        "content": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \n\nYou only have access to the tools provided below. You can only use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool in the user's next response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool-use informed by the result of the previous tool-use. Today is: 2025-12-04\n\n# Tool-Use Formatting Instructions \n\nTool-use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool-use is enclosed in <use_mcp_tool></use_mcp_tool> and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects to servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities. You can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool`.\n\nDescription: \nRequest to use a tool provided by a MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.\n\nParameters:\n- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the tool\n- tool_name: (required) The name of the tool to execute\n- arguments: (required) A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters, following the tool's input schema, quotes within string must be properly escaped, ensure it's valid JSON\n\nUsage:\n<use_mcp_tool>\n<server_name>server name here</server_name>\n<tool_name>tool name here</tool_name>\n<arguments>\n{\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\"param2\": \"value2 \\\"escaped string\\\"\"\n}\n</arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Tool-use must be placed **at the end** of your response, **top-level**, and not nested within other tags.\n- Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\nString and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.\nHere are the functions available in JSONSchema format:\n\n## Server name: tool-python\n### Tool name: create_sandbox\nDescription: Create a linux sandbox.\n\nArgs:\n    timeout: Time in seconds before the sandbox is automatically shutdown.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, the user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Thorough Analysis Requirement**:\n- For complex tasks involving document analysis, literature review, or report generation, you MUST work through **at least 7-8 turns** of analysis before producing the final answer.\n- Do NOT rush to conclusions after only 2-3 turns. Take time to:\n  - Explore different aspects of the source materials\n  - Perform multiple RAG searches with different keywords\n  - Cross-reference information from different sources\n  - Verify and validate findings\n  - Build a comprehensive understanding before synthesizing\n- Each turn should focus on a specific aspect or sub-goal\n- Only produce the final report after thorough multi-turn exploration\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. Each step must involve a single tool call, unless the task is already solved. \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, extract and summarize any partial information, patterns, constraints, or keywords that can help guide future steps.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. Do not include tool results in your response — the user will provide them.\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are a task-solving agent that uses tools step-by-step to answer the user's question. Your goal is to provide complete, accurate and well-reasoned answers using additional tools.\n\n"

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y.

From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel.

1.计划训练一个10B的模型，想知道至少需要多大的数据？ • 2.收集到了1T的数据，想知道能训练一个多大的模型？ • 3.老板准备1个月后开发布会，给的资源是100张A100，应该用多少数据训多大的模型效果最好？ • 4.老板对现在10B的模型不满意，想知道扩大到100B模型的效果能提升到多少？\n以上这些问题都可以基于Scaling Law的理论进行回答。本文是阅读了一系列 Scaling Law的文章后的整理和思考，包括Scaling Law的概念和推导以及反Scaling Law的场景，不当之处，欢迎指正。\n核心结论\n大模型的Scaling Law是 OpenAI 在2020年提出的概念[1]，具体如下:\n1.对于Decoder-only的模型，计算量( Flops ), 模型参数量N, 数据大小(token数)，三者满足: 。(推导见本文最后)\n2.模型的最终性能 主要 与计算量，模型参数量和数据大小三者相关，而与模型的具体结构(层数/深度/宽度)基本无关。\n固定模型的总参数量，调整层数/深度/宽度，不同模型的性能差距很小，大部分在2%以内\n3.对于计算量，模型参数量和数据大小，当不受其他两个因素制约时，模型性能与每个因素都呈现 幂律关系\n4.为了提升模型性能，模型参数量N和数据大小D需要同步放大，但模型和数据分别放大的比例还存在争议。\n5.Scaling Law不仅适用于 语言模型 ，还适用于其他模态以及跨模态的任务[4]：\n这里横轴单位为PF-days: 如果每秒钟可进行次运算，就是1 peta flops，那么一天的运算就是，这个算力消耗被称为1个petaflop/s-day。\n核心公式\n• 第一项是指无法通过增加模型规模来减少的损失，可以认为是数据自身的熵（例如数据中的噪音） • 第二项是指能通过增加计算量来减少的损失，可以认为是模型拟合的分布与实际分布之间的差。\n根据公式，增大(例如计算量)，模型整体loss下降，模型性能提升；伴随x趋向于无穷大，模型能拟合数据的真实分布，让第二项逼近0，整体趋向于\n大模型中的Scaling Law\nGPT4\n下图是GPT4报告[5]中的Scaling Law曲线， 计算量C和模型性能满足幂律关系\n• 横轴是归一化之后的计算量，假设GPT4的计算量为1。基于10,000倍小的计算规模，就能预测最终GPT4的性能。 • 纵轴是\"Bits for words\", 这也是交叉熵的一个单位。在计算交叉熵时，如果使用以 2 为底的对数，交叉熵的单位就是 “bits per word”，与信息论中的比特（bit）概念相符。所以这个值越低，说明模型的性能越好。\nBaichuan2\n下图是Baichuan2[6]技术报告中的Scaling Law曲线。基于10M到3B的模型在1T数据上训练的性能，可预测出最后7B模型和13B模型在2.6T数据上的性能\nMindLLM\n下图是MindLLM[7]技术报告中的Scaling Law曲线。基于10M到500M的模型在10B数据上训练的性能，预测出最后3B模型在500B数据上的性能。\nScaling Law实操: 计算效率最优\n根据幂律定律，模型的参数固定，无限堆数据并不能无限提升模型的性能，模型最终性能会慢慢趋向一个固定的值\n如图所示，如果模型的参数量为（图中紫色的线），在数量达到，模型基本收敛。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 8\nCitation: [long_context:

welfare)的新研究项目，探讨随着AI系统变得越来越复杂和类人化，是否需要对其给予道德关怀的问题，例如未来AI工具是否可能成为“道德主体”，如果有证据表明AI系统值得得到道德对待时该如何应对。6这项前瞻性研究反映了AI领域对于未来可能出现的AI意识和权利问题的重视。\n二、破解AI黑箱：四大技术路径的突破进展\n过去数年来，AI研究领域一直在试图攻克人工智能的可解释性难题，研究者们提出了各种可解释性的方法，致力于创造出类似于精准、高效的MRI（核磁共振成像）那样的工具，以清晰完整地揭示AI模型的内部机制。随着AI领域对大模型可解释性研究的重视程度不断提高，在AI模型的能力达到临界值之前，研究者们或许能够成功地实现可解释性，也就是彻底理解AI系统的内在运行机制。\n（一）自动化解释：利用一个大模型来解释另一个大模型\nOpenAI近年在模型内部机理解析上取得重要进展。2023年，OpenAI利用GPT-4对GPT-2中单个神经元在高激活样本中的共性进行归纳，并自动生成自然语言描述，实现在无需人工逐个检查的情况下，规模化获取神经元功能解释。7相当于自动给神经元“贴标签”，从而形成一个可以查询的AI内部“使用说明书”。\n例如，GPT-4给出某神经元的解释为“这个神经元主要在检测与‘社区’相关的词语”。随后验证发现，当输入文本包含诸如“society（社会）”“community（社区）”等词汇时，该神经元激活很强，证明解释具有一定有效性。8这项成果表明，大模型本身可以成为解释工具，为更小模型提供基于语义的透明度，这种自动化的神经元注释极大提升了可解释性研究的可扩展性。当然，该方法仍有局限，例如GPT-4生成的解释质量参差不齐，一些神经元行为难以用单一语义概念概括。\n（二）特征可视化：整体揭示大模型内部的知识组织方式\n对大模型整体特征的提取和分析也是一个重要方向。2023年底，OpenAI利用稀疏自编码器技术（sparse autoencoder）分析GPT-4模型的内部激活。研究人员成功提取出了数以千万计的稀疏特征（即模型“脑海”中少数被“点亮”的思维关键词），并通过可视化验证发现其中相当一部分特征具有清晰的人类可解释语义。\n例如，有的特征对应“人类不完美”的概念集合，激活在描述人类缺陷的句子上；有的特征表示“价格上涨”相关表述，激活于涉及价格上升的内容上。9短期内，OpenAI希望其发现的特征能够切实用于监测和引导语言模型的行为，并计划在其前沿模型中进行测试，以期可解释性最终能够为他们提供新的方法来思考模型的安全性和稳健性。\n2024年5月，Anthropic在其研究文章中展示他们在Claude模型中定位出数以百万计概念是如何被表示的。这项研究采用了字典学习与稀疏特征提取的方法。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

2])\n幕中的高频词，“法外狂徒张三”也成了他独树一帜的案例主角，许多让粉丝狂刷的梗是罗翔始料未及的，他成了B站中有独特话语体系的法学老师。\n还有一些惊世骇俗的段子，罗翔硬是讲出了法律的味道。有一起涉嫌组织出卖人体器官的恶性事件，罗翔是这样描述的：“同学，看你长相清秀，我出50万，你把肾卖给我吧。”“老师，我是有尊严的好不好。”“500万行不行？”“老师，我真的有尊严。”“5000万，再加上海的两套房子。”“成交！”“最后一声干脆利索，于是我把他的肾割了下来，做了一个烤腰子，吃了一口，问他要不要也吃一口，他则跟我显摆说我有钱哪。”\n“这是尊严吗”？罗翔反问道。这种尊严不过就是用钱来计算罢了，还涉嫌组织出卖人体器官罪，显然是违法的。这就是为什么法律对自由会进行一定约束，因为自由是不能以彻底放弃自由为代价的。\n另外在一起重大杀人案中，一对农民夫妇杀掉了50多个人，把尸体像摞砖一样放在自己家的地窖里，据说他们抢夺来的财产总共才500多块。后来警察问他们：杀这么多人你们就不害怕吗？他们却回答，你瞧瞧，不就是杀个人吗，多大点事呀。虽然杀第一个人的时候是有点怕的，当时尸体在二楼，我在一楼睡觉，夜深人静的时候听到楼上有血滴答滴答往下淌的声音，但是仔细一想，这个世界上又没有鬼，还有什么可怕的呢。类似这样的案子听起来很震惊，却干货十足，罗翔的各种段子也在网上不断发酵。\n“宝藏老师”\n以上各种奇葩案件，让罗翔把刑法课堂变得热闹非凡。\n法治课程讲得接地气，让一些非法律专业粉丝开始霸屏，会计学专业的慕名而来，安全工程专业前来受教，电气工程专业来报到，高一文科生也开始围观了……他们亲切地称呼罗翔是“宝藏老师”。\n在几百万粉丝的包围中，罗翔一直表现得很平静。在网络之外，罗翔说自己就是一个普通的老师而已。他谦虚地说：“那些视频课程是为一家法律职业资格考试培训机构录制的，被一些听课同学自动搬到了B站，所以受到关注可以说是无心插柳柳成荫。我不觉得自己‘火了’。我个人一直觉得，人在使命中才活得有意义，要向着标杆奔跑。”\n老师这个职业，就是罗翔心中的那杆标杆。\n在微信公众号“罗翔说刑法”上，他曾写过一篇《我的老师》的文章，回忆了读书期间导师对他的帮助。“当年我写博士论文时，导师不时会打电话督工，有时一个电话能打两个小时。每次我打电话向导师请教问题时，他会先挂掉，然后给我回拨过来，他的理由是学生话费有限。有一年大年初二，我在朋友家喝酒聚会，酒兴正浓，结果导师打来电话，说今天已经初二了，年也过得差不多了，该收心写论文了。我们也经常为一个问题争得面红耳赤，毫不客气，一点也不顾忌导师的颜面，不过毕业之后，导师还时常给我打电话，有时一个问题也要和我讨论很久。”\n罗翔觉得自己很幸运，遇到了好的老师，他把人生95%的成就归功于老师的相助，他的人生轨迹，也因为老师而变得有所不同。\n2005年，罗翔从北京大学法学院刑法学博士毕业后，成为中国政法大学的一名老师。他有一种强烈的想法，要把从老师那里接收的祝福传递给更多的学生。但现实是，做和做到之间有一座天然的鸿沟。即使是罗翔自己，有时候也很难做到有教无类。他说耐心是很容易碎掉的，可自己对老师这份职业，心中始终留有一份深厚的感情。\n因为对老师这份职业的执着，罗翔始终想着，要把课堂变得精彩有趣，在严肃和幽默之间找到平衡点。为此，他将各种法律故事契合人的常识、常情、常理进行整合，然后变成一个个带有温度的故事。这让学生找到那种“再来一亿遍”的感觉。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

系列为代表，通过答案校验引导模型进行多步推理。这类方法将复杂问题分解为长思维链（Chain-of-Thought）的决策序列，在数学证明、代码生成等场景中展现出超越监督学习的推理能力。 比之有监督学习：RL摆脱局部最优束缚、突破数据覆盖的认知边界、复杂系统长期价值建模。\n算法方法：\n传统方法（如 Q-learning） ：通常基于“价值函数”间接优化策略——先评估动作的价值，再选择最优动作。 策略梯度（Policy Gradient）方法 ：摒弃了“先估值再决策”的中间步骤，而是将策略本身参数化（例如用神经网络表示），直接通过梯度上升优化策略参数，让智能体更倾向于选择能带来高回报的动作。\n 学习时可从从策略梯度的基础概念出发，回顾经典算法如  REINFORCE，PPO  等，并讨论在大模型时代流行的  GRPO，RLOO  等方法。\n开源框架：\n字节跳动与香港大学联合开源的 RL 框架 verl（HybridFlow），为大模型强化学习训练带来了创新性的解决方案，有效解决了传统 RL/RLHF 系统灵活性和效率不足的问题。\n开源数据集：\nSummarize from Feedback：OpenAI 在2020年就将RLHF技术引入摘要生成，该数据集分为两部分：对比部分和轴向部分。对比部分共计 17.9 万条数据，标注者从两个摘要中选择一个更好的摘要。轴向部分则有共计 1.5 万条数据，使用 Likert 量表为摘要的质量评分。对比部分仅有训练和验证划分，而轴向部分仅有测试和验证划分 WebGPT的人类反馈数据集：来指导模型提升长文档问答能力，该数据集包含在 WebGPT 项目结束时被标记为适合奖励建模的所有对比数据，总计 1.9 万条数据。 其他：Anthropic 的HH-RLHF数据集、Stanford Human Preferences（SHP）数据集。\n4、推理效率优化（模型、训练、推理）\n大模型的推理过程与其他深度学习模型（如 BERT、ResNet 等）非常不同，BERT 的执行时间通常是确定且高度可预测的。\n但在大语言模型的推理过程中，虽然每次迭代执行时间具有确定性，但 迭代次数（输出长度）是未知的 。\n影响效率指标的关键因素：计算成本、内存访问成本、内存使用情况。\n 核心原因：模型规模、自注意力机制（计算复杂度核心来源）、解码方法。\n效率优化方法：\n模型优化：\n优化模型结构 （ 高效 FFN 设计、注意力机制优化、MoE 架构设计、Transformer 代替架构设计 ）\n模型压缩 （ 修改模型的数据表示（例如量化）、改变其架构（例如稀疏化、结构优化等）、知识蒸馏 来提高推理效率）\n低精度训练：\n前主流训练框架（例如 Megatron-LM、MetaSeq 和 Colossal-AI）仍采用 FP32 全精度或混合精度的 FP16/BF16 策略。\n随着 Nvidia H100 GPU 的推出， FP8  正逐渐成为下一代低精度数据表示的主流格式。面临 数据下溢或上溢问题 。\n推理优化： 算法级 （多模型推测解码、KV-cache 优化）、 系统级 （模型/硬件并行化策略、显存优化、调度优化、网络请求优化、采样解码加速等）。\n5、部署与应用\n三层工作：\n基础层：大模型、深度学习框架（Pytorch/Tensorflow）、硬件算力支持（GPU/TPU集群）。 部署层：模型压缩/量化/剪枝、推理优化（TensorRT、ONNX Runtime）、部署架构（云原生/嵌入式边缘端）、服务化封装（API网关、负载均衡）。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 3\nCitation: [long_context: \"给小白的大模型入门科普-20250304003342.docx-原创力文档\", chunk

1.计划训练一个10B的模型，想知道至少需要多大的数据？ • 2.收集到了1T的数据，想知道能训练一个多大的模型？ • 3.老板准备1个月后开发布会，给的资源是100张A100，应该用多少数据训多大的模型效果最好？ • 4.老板对现在10B的模型不满意，想知道扩大到100B模型的效果能提升到多少？\n以上这些问题都可以基于Scaling Law的理论进行回答。本文是阅读了一系列 Scaling Law的文章后的整理和思考，包括Scaling Law的概念和推导以及反Scaling Law的场景，不当之处，欢迎指正。\n核心结论\n大模型的Scaling Law是 OpenAI 在2020年提出的概念[1]，具体如下:\n1.对于Decoder-only的模型，计算量( Flops ), 模型参数量N, 数据大小(token数)，三者满足: 。(推导见本文最后)\n2.模型的最终性能 主要 与计算量，模型参数量和数据大小三者相关，而与模型的具体结构(层数/深度/宽度)基本无关。\n固定模型的总参数量，调整层数/深度/宽度，不同模型的性能差距很小，大部分在2%以内\n3.对于计算量，模型参数量和数据大小，当不受其他两个因素制约时，模型性能与每个因素都呈现 幂律关系\n4.为了提升模型性能，模型参数量N和数据大小D需要同步放大，但模型和数据分别放大的比例还存在争议。\n5.Scaling Law不仅适用于 语言模型 ，还适用于其他模态以及跨模态的任务[4]：\n这里横轴单位为PF-days: 如果每秒钟可进行次运算，就是1 peta flops，那么一天的运算就是，这个算力消耗被称为1个petaflop/s-day。\n核心公式\n• 第一项是指无法通过增加模型规模来减少的损失，可以认为是数据自身的熵（例如数据中的噪音） • 第二项是指能通过增加计算量来减少的损失，可以认为是模型拟合的分布与实际分布之间的差。\n根据公式，增大(例如计算量)，模型整体loss下降，模型性能提升；伴随x趋向于无穷大，模型能拟合数据的真实分布，让第二项逼近0，整体趋向于\n大模型中的Scaling Law\nGPT4\n下图是GPT4报告[5]中的Scaling Law曲线， 计算量C和模型性能满足幂律关系\n• 横轴是归一化之后的计算量，假设GPT4的计算量为1。基于10,000倍小的计算规模，就能预测最终GPT4的性能。 • 纵轴是\"Bits for words\", 这也是交叉熵的一个单位。在计算交叉熵时，如果使用以 2 为底的对数，交叉熵的单位就是 “bits per word”，与信息论中的比特（bit）概念相符。所以这个值越低，说明模型的性能越好。\nBaichuan2\n下图是Baichuan2[6]技术报告中的Scaling Law曲线。基于10M到3B的模型在1T数据上训练的性能，可预测出最后7B模型和13B模型在2.6T数据上的性能\nMindLLM\n下图是MindLLM[7]技术报告中的Scaling Law曲线。基于10M到500M的模型在10B数据上训练的性能，预测出最后3B模型在500B数据上的性能。\nScaling Law实操: 计算效率最优\n根据幂律定律，模型的参数固定，无限堆数据并不能无限提升模型的性能，模型最终性能会慢慢趋向一个固定的值\n如图所示，如果模型的参数量为（图中紫色的线），在数量达到，模型基本收敛。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 5\nCitation: [long_context:

Sonnet，成功发现该模型内部蕴含着大量抽象概念的表示。\nAnthropic指出，由于每个概念往往由多个神经元共同表示、每个神经元也参与表示多个概念，因此直接查看单个神经元难以识别概念，而他们的方法将模型任一内部状态重新表达为少量特征的组合，有效降低了复杂性。比如，对于任意一段输入文本，Claude内部可能有上万个神经元激活，但可以提取出其中几十个显著特征，这些特征对应于高层语义概念，使研究者能够以接近人类思维的方式来看待模型此刻的“想法”。10这种特征化重构不仅增强了对模型内部逻辑的可读性，也为理解AI“当下在想什么”提供了更接近人类认知的分析路径。\n（三）思维链监控：对大模型\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

基本认知\n从 2022 年开始，大语言模型的数量呈爆发式的增长，各大公司和研究机构都在发布不同类型的大语言模型。\n基础模型是指仅经过预训练的模型；\n对话模型是指在预训练模型基础上经过有监督微调和强化学习训练的模型，具备对话和完成任务的能力；\n推理模型是指专注于逻辑推理增强的大语言模型。\n大模型全称 大语言模型 （现发展有多模态大模型）\n≥数百亿参数的深度神经网络\n新范式： 预训练+指令微调！\n训练方式： 大量无标注文本进行自监督学习\n记住下面这些开源模型：\n学习大模型最基本要有深度学习基础，其次是一个大模型中的一个核心模型—— Transformer ，难点也在这里，无论是训练原理、推理、效率优化都以底层原理为基础，其次就是实操工程经验了！\nTransformer中的核心就是“自注意力机制”，且可多头并行，为并行加速提供了契机！\n02 构建流程\n以OpenAI的公开信息，主要包含四个阶段：预训练、有监督微调、奖励建模和强化学习。每个阶段所需的 数据集规模、算法类型、产生的模型、时间和GPU资源 都不相同：\n1、预训练\n预训练的灵感来自CV中的ImageNet，使用训练数据训练出一个 具备通用且强大的自然语言表示能力 ，该模型能有效学习到词汇、语法、语义等信息。\n要理解这点，你需要知道——Transformer训练大模型的本质的是得到一个 预测模型 ，即通过已有的语言序列预测下一个词，不断，反复 在支持的最长上下文限制窗口内 进行。\n（1）预训练数据集\n数据集分类、预处理：\n通用数据集：网页、图书、新闻、对话文本等。规模大、多样性和易获取。\n专业数据集：多语言数据、科学文本数据、代码及领域特有资料等。预训练时引入专业数据集可有效提高大模型解决任务的能力。\n初筛： 质量过滤、去冗余、隐私消除 。\n词元切分： Tokenization 将原始文本分割成词元序列的过程，是数据预处理中至关重要的一步。\n影响分析：数据规模、质量和多样性评估。分析数据对大语言模型训练所需资源或预估模型性能的影响。\n开源数据集：Pile、RefinedWeb、ROOTS、CulturaX、SlimPajama等。\n（2）分布式预训练\n训练是自监督的，并行策略：\n数据并行：每个计算设备都有整个神经网络模型的模型副本 Model Replica ，进行迭代时，每个计算设备只分配一个批次数据样本的子集，并根据该批次样本子集的数据进行网络模型的前向计算。DP、DDP、FSDP、ZeRO等。\n模型并行：用于解决单节点内存不足的问题。分为两种： 层间并行（算子间并行/流水线并行PP）、层内并行（算子内并行/张量并行TP） 。还有SP、EP。\n混合并行：将多种并行策略如数据并行、流水线并行和张量并行等混合使用。\n训练配置： 正则化方法、激活函数、优化器 等。\n训练的集群架构：\n硬件组成：多个计算加速器组成的服务器、架顶交换机、骨干交换机等组成，往往为树形结构。\n其他：参数服务器PS架构、去中心化架构。\n2、指令微调（有监督微调SFT）\n得到预训练完的基础模型后，模型虽然具备了大量的“知识”，但是由于其训练时的目标 仅是进行后续词的预测

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x).

The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases.

Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely.

With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

For the DPO and IPO loss,\nthe directions of the updating signals are identical.

Generally, larger this value leads to a bigger a, making the norm of Gt smaller.\nπθt (y−\nIn other words, we see a “regularizing” effect in this term, where the model should not make Gap(πθt)\ntoo large. The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al.

In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu .

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning. By qualitatively comparing the trend difference between curves coming from Dprob\nand Dprobtest, we roughly observe that trend_diff(y+\ngpts) >\ntrend_diff(y+\ngptf), which aligns well with our hypothesis about how strong the “pull up” pressure influence\ndifferent responses.\n\nj̸=u) > trend_diff(y+\n\nu ) > trend_diff(y+\n\n(a) Result of SFT on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result of SFT on UltraFeedback.\n\nu increase and y−\n\nj̸=u increases with a smaller rate than y+\n\nu first increase then decrease; 2.) both y+\n\nFigure 13: The learning dynamics of responses in different groups in the proposed probing dataset.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_32k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_32k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 664.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Transformer原理及大模型架构  \nTransformer模型以自注意力机制为核心，能够高效捕捉序列中远程依赖。多头注意力机制和并行结构为模型带来了强大表达力和训练效率。现代大模型一般由输入层、深层堆叠的Transformer隐含层、以及输出层组成，参数规模往往达到数十亿乃至百亿，模型的自身大规模也是其自我泛化和多任务迁移能力的技术基础[long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝阳AI社区\", chunk 1][long_context: \"给小白的大模型入门科普-20250304003342.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 3]。\n\n2. SFT与DPO算法机制与对比  \nSFT（有监督微调）是在通用预训练模型之上，用专门采集的指令问答数据做定向训练，让模型具备遵循任务指令的能力，训练目标仅针对输出部分计算损失。DPO（直接偏好优化）则通过人类偏好反馈、对比学习等方式，让模型能区分和优先生成更贴合人类预期的回答，训练信号兼有正负样本，优化目标注重模型与基线或参考输出的KL散度调节，强调对齐人类“价值指令”能力的提升[文档: pdf.pdf][long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝阳AI社区\", chunk 1]。\n\n3. 神经切线核与学习动力学  \nNTK（Neural Tangent Kernel）理论关注在参数更新过程中，训练集样本之间影响力如何通过梯度传递扩散，能定量衡量不同样本影响关系，是刻画模型泛化、类间/跨任务信息迁移的重要理论基础[文档: pdf.pdf][long_context: \"给小白的大模型入门科普-20250304003342.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 3]。\n\n4. “squeezing effect”机制及其影响  \n论文提出的squeezing effect，即大模型在DPO等负样本优化过程中，若对低概率输出施加大梯度，模型概率分布会被极度集中至极少数高基础概率词，从而出现“重复输出”“幻觉”等LLM常见不良现象。相反，SFT阶段主要是对目标概率“推高”，相近回答会受连带影响，但分布不会像DPO那样极端。论文实验中通过补充训练策略（如SFT提前引入负样本），成功缓解了此风险。[文档: pdf.pdf]\n\n5.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2.

We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y.

Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well.

From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect.

The second\none is for SFT and the third one is for DPO.

The 2-D plane of Y by considering the distance in both format and semantics.\n\nD.1 THE SELECTION OF RESPONSE TYPES FOR THE PROBING DATASET\n\nBesides the sequential nature of the loss function, another conundrum in analyzing LLM learning dynamics is\nthe huge response space Y: the number of possible y ∈ Y is V L, but the vast majority of possible sequences\nlook nothing like natural language, and we expect the model to generate only a subset of natural language-like\nresponses. These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_32k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_32k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 664.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

SFT与DPO算法机制与对比  \nSFT（有监督微调）是在通用预训练模型之上，用专门采集的指令问答数据做定向训练，让模型具备遵循任务指令的能力，训练目标仅针对输出部分计算损失。DPO（直接偏好优化）则通过人类偏好反馈、对比学习等方式，让模型能区分和优先生成更贴合人类预期的回答，训练信号兼有正负样本，优化目标注重模型与基线或参考输出的KL散度调节，强调对齐人类“价值指令”能力的提升[文档: pdf.pdf][long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝阳AI社区\", chunk 1]。\n\n3. 神经切线核与学习动力学  \nNTK（Neural Tangent Kernel）理论关注在参数更新过程中，训练集样本之间影响力如何通过梯度传递扩散，能定量衡量不同样本影响关系，是刻画模型泛化、类间/跨任务信息迁移的重要理论基础[文档: pdf.pdf][long_context: \"给小白的大模型入门科普-20250304003342.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 3]。\n\n4. “squeezing effect”机制及其影响  \n论文提出的squeezing effect，即大模型在DPO等负样本优化过程中，若对低概率输出施加大梯度，模型概率分布会被极度集中至极少数高基础概率词，从而出现“重复输出”“幻觉”等LLM常见不良现象。相反，SFT阶段主要是对目标概率“推高”，相近回答会受连带影响，但分布不会像DPO那样极端。论文实验中通过补充训练策略（如SFT提前引入负样本），成功缓解了此风险。[文档: pdf.pdf]\n\n5.

SFT与DPO算法机制与对比  \nSFT（有监督微调）是在通用预训练模型之上，用专门采集的指令问答数据做定向训练，让模型具备遵循任务指令的能力，训练目标仅针对输出部分计算损失。DPO（直接偏好优化）则通过人类偏好反馈、对比学习等方式，让模型能区分和优先生成更贴合人类预期的回答，训练信号兼有正负样本，优化目标注重模型与基线或参考输出的KL散度调节，强调对齐人类“价值指令”能力的提升[文档: pdf.pdf][long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝阳AI社区\", chunk 1]。\n\n3. 神经切线核与学习动力学  \nNTK（Neural Tangent Kernel）理论关注在参数更新过程中，训练集样本之间影响力如何通过梯度传递扩散，能定量衡量不同样本影响关系，是刻画模型泛化、类间/跨任务信息迁移的重要理论基础[文档: pdf.pdf][long_context: \"给小白的大模型入门科普-20250304003342.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 3]。\n\n4. “squeezing effect”机制及其影响  \n论文提出的squeezing effect，即大模型在DPO等负样本优化过程中，若对低概率输出施加大梯度，模型概率分布会被极度集中至极少数高基础概率词，从而出现“重复输出”“幻觉”等LLM常见不良现象。相反，SFT阶段主要是对目标概率“推高”，相近回答会受连带影响，但分布不会像DPO那样极端。论文实验中通过补充训练策略（如SFT提前引入负样本），成功缓解了此风险。[文档: pdf.pdf]\n\n5.
