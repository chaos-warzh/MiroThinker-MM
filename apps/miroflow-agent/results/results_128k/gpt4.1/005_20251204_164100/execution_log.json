Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y.

Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, the user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Thorough Analysis Requirement**:\n- For complex tasks involving document analysis, literature review, or report generation, you MUST work through **at least 7-8 turns** of analysis before producing the final answer.\n- Do NOT rush to conclusions after only 2-3 turns. Take time to:\n  - Explore different aspects of the source materials\n  - Perform multiple RAG searches with different keywords\n  - Cross-reference information from different sources\n  - Verify and validate findings\n  - Build a comprehensive understanding before synthesizing\n- Each turn should focus on a specific aspect or sub-goal\n- Only produce the final report after thorough multi-turn exploration\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. Each step must involve a single tool call, unless the task is already solved. \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, extract and summarize any partial information, patterns, constraints, or keywords that can help guide future steps.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. Do not include tool results in your response — the user will provide them.\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are a task-solving agent that uses tools step-by-step to answer the user's question. Your goal is to provide complete, accurate and well-reasoned answers using additional tools.\n\n",

        "content": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \n\nYou only have access to the tools provided below. You can only use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool in the user's next response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool-use informed by the result of the previous tool-use. Today is: 2025-12-04\n\n# Tool-Use Formatting Instructions \n\nTool-use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool-use is enclosed in <use_mcp_tool></use_mcp_tool> and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects to servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities. You can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool`.\n\nDescription: \nRequest to use a tool provided by a MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.\n\nParameters:\n- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the tool\n- tool_name: (required) The name of the tool to execute\n- arguments: (required) A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters, following the tool's input schema, quotes within string must be properly escaped, ensure it's valid JSON\n\nUsage:\n<use_mcp_tool>\n<server_name>server name here</server_name>\n<tool_name>tool name here</tool_name>\n<arguments>\n{\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\"param2\": \"value2 \\\"escaped string\\\"\"\n}\n</arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Tool-use must be placed **at the end** of your response, **top-level**, and not nested within other tags.\n- Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\nString and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.\nHere are the functions available in JSONSchema format:\n\n## Server name: tool-python\n### Tool name: create_sandbox\nDescription: Create a linux sandbox.\n\nArgs:\n    timeout: Time in seconds before the sandbox is automatically shutdown.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, the user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Thorough Analysis Requirement**:\n- For complex tasks involving document analysis, literature review, or report generation, you MUST work through **at least 7-8 turns** of analysis before producing the final answer.\n- Do NOT rush to conclusions after only 2-3 turns. Take time to:\n  - Explore different aspects of the source materials\n  - Perform multiple RAG searches with different keywords\n  - Cross-reference information from different sources\n  - Verify and validate findings\n  - Build a comprehensive understanding before synthesizing\n- Each turn should focus on a specific aspect or sub-goal\n- Only produce the final report after thorough multi-turn exploration\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. Each step must involve a single tool call, unless the task is already solved. \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, extract and summarize any partial information, patterns, constraints, or keywords that can help guide future steps.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. Do not include tool results in your response — the user will provide them.\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are a task-solving agent that uses tools step-by-step to answer the user's question. Your goal is to provide complete, accurate and well-reasoned answers using additional tools.\n\n"

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

7个小时教学视频的总结和拓展阅读笔记，推荐去看原视频，很精彩，链接在文末。从最常用的聊天应用过程分析开始，引入对话过程原理浅析，再到LLM训练过程；再结合当前主流的应用形式，在得知最新用法的同时，加深对LLM的理解；再谈谈AI的最新重大进展MCP；以及作为JAVAer，在Java领域有哪些前沿能力去整合LLM。\n最后再罗列一下再公司内部一些AI平台、工具。最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案，以费曼学习法为标准，产出可教学的资料。本文是个人所学梳理和所想记录，作为AI的小白，个人知识有限，难免有所错误、疏漏，请及时纠偏、不吝赐教，感谢。\n1 大模型聊天过程分析\n我打开AI聊天窗口https://chat.deepseek.com，发送我的Query：\n1.1 流程浅析\n当我们开始一个LLM聊天对话，输入问题时，实际上大模型托管服务有内置的上下文信息，在我们输入信息，按下发送按钮时，大模型收到的是内置上下文 + 系统服务Prompt + 用户输入信息。\n大模型经过神经网络的概率统计（权重拟合)得到下一个要说的词，通过流式响应逐个词丢回会话窗口，用户就能看到大模型“正在打字”和我们聊天。“打字”的速度就是大模型响应的速度，通常看描述LLM性能的一个指标N token/s。\n1.2 原理浅析\n本质就是从输入的 tokens 推测下一个 token 的出现概率，将可能性较高的作为输出token，再将得到的token添加到输入中，直到满足结束条件（上下文长度限制、结束符以较高概率出现、用户定义的停止条件、概率阈值与采样策略、模型架构的隐式结束符）。所以LLM本质上是一个具有统计概率的知识记忆模糊的知识回顾系统，也可简称概率性复读机。那么这个回顾系统是怎么实现的呢，“zip文件”怎么得来的？构建一个现代的LLM三个步骤：**预训练、后训练（SFT）和强化学习（RL\\RLHF)**。\n1.3 预训练\n在预训练过程中，需要有原始数据和验证数据，所以通常可以将数据集分为两份，例如90%用于训练，10%用于验证（具体比例可能因任务调整）。\n1.3.1 数据集\n数据集生成流程：\n列举主流网站的URL\n有害网站URL过滤，垃圾站点、成人内容等\n从URL网站响应的富文本提取文字内容\n文本语言过滤，如仅针保留英文或者中文内容，在huggingface上数据集语言分布前5如下图：\nGopher 过滤，去除无意义、低信息量或有害内容（如垃圾文本、暴力、偏见等）\nMinHash 去重，用于快速检测并移除数据集中的重复或近似重复的文本片段（如文档、段落或句子）。其核心目的是减少数据冗余，避免模型因重复数据过拟合或偏向高频内容，同时节省计算资源。\nC4 过滤，C4（Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus） 数据集进行清洗和筛选的步骤，旨在从原始网页文本中提取高质量、多样化的语料，同时去除噪声、重复和低效内容。\nCustom Filters（自定义过滤器）目标是针对通用过滤方法（如MinHash去重、C4/Gopher过滤）无法覆盖的领域特殊性问题，进行更精细化的数据质量控制。\nPII Removal（个人身份信息移除） 是指从原始数据中识别并删除或匿名化 个人身份信息（Personally Identifiable Information, PII） 的关键步骤，旨在保护用户隐私、遵守数据保护法规（如GDPR、CCPA），并降低模型泄露敏感信息的风险。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 4\nCitation: [long_context: \"7 个影响 LLM 生成结果的关键参数，精准解读与应用建议：• Max

LLM（十三）DeepSeek-R1论文全文翻译\n\n--- Content ---\n(Cite as: [long_context: \"LLM（十三）DeepSeek-R1论文全文翻译\", chunk 1])\n论文题目：《DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning》\n论文地址 ：https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf\n以下是论文的翻译内容：\n摘要\n 我们介绍第一代推理模型：DeepSeek-R1-Zero 和 DeepSeek-R1。DeepSeek-R1-Zero 是一个完全通过大规模强化学习（RL）训练而无需监督微调（SFT）作为初步步骤的模型，展示了显著的推理能力。通过RL，DeepSeek-R1-Zero 自然地展现出许多强大且有趣的推理行为。然而，它也遇到了一些挑战，如可读性差和语言混合问题。为了解决这些问题并进一步提高推理性能，我们引入了DeepSeek-R1，它在RL之前引入了多阶段训练和冷启动数据。DeepSeek-R1 在推理任务上的表现与OpenAI-o1-1217相当。为了支持研究社区，我们将DeepSeek-R1-Zero、DeepSeek-R1以及基于Qwen和Llama从DeepSeek-R1提炼出的六个密集模型（1.5B、7B、8B、14B、32B、70B）开源。\n第一章 引言\n 近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）经历了快速迭代和发展（Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a），逐渐缩小了与人工通用智能（AGI）之间的差距。\n 最近，后训练已经成为完整训练管道的重要组成部分。研究表明，这种方法可以在推理任务上提高准确性，符合社会价值观，并适应用户偏好，同时相对于预训练所需的计算资源相对较少。在推理能力方面，OpenAI的o1系列模型首先通过增加链式思考（Chain-of-Thought, CoT）过程的长度引入了推断时缩放方法。这种方法在各种推理任务中取得了显著进展，例如数学、编程和科学推理。然而，有效测试时缩放仍然是研究界的一个开放问题。先前的工作探索了多种方法，包括基于过程的奖励模型（Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023）、强化学习（Kumar et al., 2024）以及搜索算法如蒙特卡洛树搜索和束搜索（Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024）。然而，这些方法均未达到与OpenAI的o1系列模型相媲美的普遍推理性能。\n 在本文中，我们首次尝试使用纯强化学习（RL）来改进语言模型的推理能力。我们的目标是探索LLMs在没有任何监督数据的情况下发展推理能力的潜力，专注于其通过纯RL过程的自我进化。具体来说，我们使用DeepSeek-V3-Base作为基础模型，并采用GRPO（Shao et al., 2024）作为RL框架，以提高模型在推理中的表现。在训练过程中，DeepSeek-R1-Zero自然地展现了许多强大且有趣的推理行为。经过数千次RL步骤后，DeepSeek-R1-Zero在推理基准测试中表现出色。例如，在AIME 2024上的pass@1得分从15.6%提高到71.0%，并且通过多数投票，得分进一步提高到86.7%，达到了与OpenAI-o1-0912相当的水平。\n 然而，DeepSeek-R1-Zero面临的问题包括可读性差和语言混合。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 8\nCitation: [long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk

7个小时教学视频的总结和拓展阅读笔记，推荐去看原视频，很精彩，链接在文末。从最常用的聊天应用过程分析开始，引入对话过程原理浅析，再到LLM训练过程；再结合当前主流的应用形式，在得知最新用法的同时，加深对LLM的理解；再谈谈AI的最新重大进展MCP；以及作为JAVAer，在Java领域有哪些前沿能力去整合LLM。\n最后再罗列一下再公司内部一些AI平台、工具。最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案，以费曼学习法为标准，产出可教学的资料。本文是个人所学梳理和所想记录，作为AI的小白，个人知识有限，难免有所错误、疏漏，请及时纠偏、不吝赐教，感谢。\n1 大模型聊天过程分析\n我打开AI聊天窗口https://chat.deepseek.com，发送我的Query：\n1.1 流程浅析\n当我们开始一个LLM聊天对话，输入问题时，实际上大模型托管服务有内置的上下文信息，在我们输入信息，按下发送按钮时，大模型收到的是内置上下文 + 系统服务Prompt + 用户输入信息。\n大模型经过神经网络的概率统计（权重拟合)得到下一个要说的词，通过流式响应逐个词丢回会话窗口，用户就能看到大模型“正在打字”和我们聊天。“打字”的速度就是大模型响应的速度，通常看描述LLM性能的一个指标N token/s。\n1.2 原理浅析\n本质就是从输入的 tokens 推测下一个 token 的出现概率，将可能性较高的作为输出token，再将得到的token添加到输入中，直到满足结束条件（上下文长度限制、结束符以较高概率出现、用户定义的停止条件、概率阈值与采样策略、模型架构的隐式结束符）。所以LLM本质上是一个具有统计概率的知识记忆模糊的知识回顾系统，也可简称概率性复读机。那么这个回顾系统是怎么实现的呢，“zip文件”怎么得来的？构建一个现代的LLM三个步骤：**预训练、后训练（SFT）和强化学习（RL\\RLHF)**。\n1.3 预训练\n在预训练过程中，需要有原始数据和验证数据，所以通常可以将数据集分为两份，例如90%用于训练，10%用于验证（具体比例可能因任务调整）。\n1.3.1 数据集\n数据集生成流程：\n列举主流网站的URL\n有害网站URL过滤，垃圾站点、成人内容等\n从URL网站响应的富文本提取文字内容\n文本语言过滤，如仅针保留英文或者中文内容，在huggingface上数据集语言分布前5如下图：\nGopher 过滤，去除无意义、低信息量或有害内容（如垃圾文本、暴力、偏见等）\nMinHash 去重，用于快速检测并移除数据集中的重复或近似重复的文本片段（如文档、段落或句子）。其核心目的是减少数据冗余，避免模型因重复数据过拟合或偏向高频内容，同时节省计算资源。\nC4 过滤，C4（Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus） 数据集进行清洗和筛选的步骤，旨在从原始网页文本中提取高质量、多样化的语料，同时去除噪声、重复和低效内容。\nCustom Filters（自定义过滤器）目标是针对通用过滤方法（如MinHash去重、C4/Gopher过滤）无法覆盖的领域特殊性问题，进行更精细化的数据质量控制。\nPII Removal（个人身份信息移除） 是指从原始数据中识别并删除或匿名化 个人身份信息（Personally Identifiable Information, PII） 的关键步骤，旨在保护用户隐私、遵守数据保护法规（如GDPR、CCPA），并降低模型泄露敏感信息的风险。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 4\nCitation: [long_context: \"博睿数据发布！LLM在可观测性体系建设落地的30大核心技术应用场景-知乎\",

职称论文‘研究方法’怎么写？实证vs.理论如何选？-搜狐\n\n--- Content ---\n(Cite as: [long_context: \"职称论文‘研究方法’怎么写？实证vs.理论如何选？-搜狐\", chunk 1])\n在撰写职称论文时，研究方法的选择是决定论文质量与学术价值的关键环节。面对实证研究与理论研究的路径分歧，研究者需结合学科特点、研究目标及自身条件进行系统性考量。本文将从方法论本质、适用场景、操作流程及常见误区四个维度展开分析，为学者提供具有实践指导意义的解决方案。\n一、方法论的本质差异与互补性\n实证研究与理论研究构成社会科学研究的两种基本范式。实证研究强调\"用数据说话\"，通过问卷调查、实验设计、案例观察等手段收集可量化的经验证据，采用统计分析方法验证假设，如某高校管理学院对456名企业中层干部的跟踪研究（百度百家号，2023），通过结构方程模型揭示了领导风格与团队绩效的量化关系。其优势在于结论的客观性和可重复性，但存在样本代表性和测量效度等挑战。\n理论研究则侧重概念演绎和逻辑推演，包括文献分析、比较研究、模型构建等方法。知乎专栏《社科研究方法论》（2023）指出，理论研究适用于探索新兴领域或解构复杂概念，如组织行为学中的\"心理契约\"理论发展，通过批判性整合32篇经典文献，建立了新的分析框架。其价值在于思维深度和解释张力，但需警惕陷入\"空对空\"的思辨陷阱。\n两种范式并非对立关系。CSDN技术社区案例（2023）显示，优秀的职称论文往往采用\"理论-实证-理论\"的螺旋结构：先通过文献综述建立理论模型，再用实证数据检验，最后回归理论修正。这种混合研究方法在管理学和经济学领域应用尤为广泛。\n二、学科适配与选题决策矩阵\n选择研究方法需建立三维评估体系：\n1. **学科特性**：实验心理学、临床医学等硬科学通常要求实证设计；哲学、美学等人文学科侧重理论思辨；而教育学、社会学等中间学科则需灵活选择。某核心期刊评审数据显示（百度新闻，2023），经济学领域实证论文录用率比纯理论论文高17%，但理论创新类论文更易获得高引用。\n2. **问题类型**：解释\"是什么\"和\"为什么\"的问题适合理论研究，如《数字化转型的伦理困境》这类选题；探究\"怎么样\"和\"如何做\"的问题需要实证支撑，像《在线教学平台使用效能评估》这类应用研究。\n3. **资源条件**：时间紧张（3个月内）建议选择文献研究或二手数据分析；拥有调研渠道的可采用问卷调查；具备实验条件的可设计对照研究。某省社科基金评审专家透露（知乎回答，2023），约43%被拒稿的实证论文失败于数据采集不足。  决策工具推荐使用\"STEAM模型\"：Significance（意义）、Theoretical space（理论空间）、Empirical feasibility（实证可行性）、Academic basis（学术基础）、Methodological maturity（方法成熟度）。每个维度按1-5分评估，总分≥18分适合实证研究，≤12分建议理论探索。  三、规范操作流程与质量控制  **实证研究实施要点**：  1. 抽样设计需明确总体边界与抽样方法，某高校职称评审要求（2023）特别强调样本量计算公式的呈现；  2. 测量工具应报告信效度检验结果，如Cronbach's α值≥0.7；  3. 数据分析要避免方法滥用，多元回归分析需先检验多重共线性（VIF<10）；  4. 伦理审查不可或缺，涉及人体研究需提供知情同意书。  **理论研究执行规范**：  1. 文献检索应覆盖中英文核心数据库，某C刊要求参考文献中外文比例不低于3:7；  2. 理论框架构建需呈现清晰的逻辑演进图；  3. 观点创新要说明与既有理论的对话点；  4. 论证过程需遵守MECE（相互独立完全穷尽）原则。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 7\nCitation: [long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk

（250K）。\n1.3.4 数据分片\n将大规模训练数据集划分为多个逻辑或物理片段（Shard）的技术，目的是实现高效的数据并行处理和分布式训练。\n数据分片的核心作用：\n解决内存与存储限制 ：单个节点无法加载全部数据，分片后每个节点仅处理部分数据。 并行加速训练 ：不同分片由不同计算设备并行处理（如GPU），缩短训练时间。 容错性 ：单个分片损坏或失败时，只需重新处理该分片，而非整个数据集。\n我们知道数据集是一张表，所以数据分片的方式方法和传统结构化数据分片类似，但这里要结合训练过程的实际情况做调整，数据分片常见方法：\n静态分片，预先规划好分片，每个GPU固定处理指定分片，优点实现简单，缺点是实际训练过程中可能导致GPU负载不平衡，因为数据集中的每一行长度是不同的，所以会导致数据倾斜。 动态分片，训练过程中动态分配数据（如通过中央调度器或分布式文件系统），优点：自动平衡负载，适应数据异构性。缺点：实现复杂，需额外协调开销（如Apache Spark或Ray框架）。 分片与数据管道的结合，流水线加载：当一个GPU处理当前分片时，异步预加载下一个分片（隐藏I/O延迟）；格式优化：分片常存储为高效二进制格式（如TFRecord、HDF5），加速读取。\n1.3.5 模型架构选择\n当前主流LLM通常是采用Transformer结构，包含自主力(Self-Attention)和多头注意力(Multi-Head Attention)的注意力层、前馈神经网络(FFN)，注意力层+FFN等模块组成一层，需要确定模型的层数和参数量。\n主流架构 ：Transformer（基于自注意力机制），常见变体：\nDecoder-only （GPT系列）：适合生成任务，单向注意力掩码。 Encoder-decoder （T5、BART）：适合翻译等序列到序列任务。\n规模参数 ：\n层数（L）：12-100+（如GPT-3 davinci版本包含96层） 隐藏层维度（d_model）：768-12,288 注意力头数（h）：12-128\nTransformer结构 ：\n自注意力机制 ：计算输入序列中每个位置的关联权重（如多头注意力）。 前馈网络（FFN） ：每个注意力层后接非线性变换。 层数与参数量 ：例如，GPT-3有1750亿参数，包含96层Transformer块。\n1.3.6 训练任务设计、执行和优化\n预训练任务设计\n自监督学习 ：无需人工标注，通过文本自身生成监督信号。\n因果语言建模（CLM） ：预测下一个Token，目标函数：\n掩码语言建模（MLM） ：随机遮盖部分Token并预测（如BERT），遮盖比例通常15%。\n混合目标 ：如UniLM结合双向和单向预测。\n训练执行\n训练过程\n分布式训练，并行策略执行、通信优化，每一轮训练（单步训练）流程包括：\n数据加载与预处理，可以是分布式数据加载，或动态批次构建。 前向传播（含激活重计算） 反向传播 梯度同步（数据并行） 参数更新（含梯度裁剪）\nTransformer结构的训练通常需要经过上万轮的训练，即上万个训练步数，训练时会充分利用GPU并行的特性，在分布式训练中并行，包括数据并行、模型并行、张量并行、流水线并行，且总GPU数 = 数据并行度 × 模型并行度。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

**理论研究执行规范**：  1. 文献检索应覆盖中英文核心数据库，某C刊要求参考文献中外文比例不低于3:7；  2. 理论框架构建需呈现清晰的逻辑演进图；  3. 观点创新要说明与既有理论的对话点；  4. 论证过程需遵守MECE（相互独立完全穷尽）原则。  质量控制方面，建议建立\"双盲校验\"机制：邀请同行专家对理论逻辑进行证伪测试，安排统计专业人员复核数据分析过程。某学术不端检测报告显示（2023），方法论缺陷导致的退修意见占比达61%。  四、典型误区与高阶技巧  常见陷阱包括：  1. \"方法崇拜症\"：盲目使用复杂模型却忽视问题本质，如用机器学习算法分析仅30个样本的数据；  2. \"数据驱动型\"研究：先收集数据再拼凑理论框架，导致\"削足适履\"；  3. \"文献堆砌\"：理论综述沦为摘要汇编，缺乏批判性整合。  进阶策略建议：  - 理论创新可采用\"沙漏模型\"：从广博的文献综述聚焦到具体问题，再拓展到普遍意义；  - 实证设计可尝试\"三角验证法\"：定量数据+定性访谈+文献证据相互印证；  - 混合方法研究注意\"权重设计\"，如主要采用实证研究时，理论部分占比建议控制在30%以内。  期刊偏好分析显示（2023数据），实证论文在《科研管理》等应用类期刊更受青睐，而《学术月刊》等综合类期刊理论创新权重更高。学者应根据目标期刊特点调整方法侧重，同时保持学术诚信底线。  结语：研究方法的选择本质上是学术价值观的体现。优秀的职称论文应当使方法与问题形成\"榫卯结构\"，无论是实证的精确之美还是理论的思辨之光，最终都要服务于知识创新的根本目的。建议研究者建立个人方法论清单，定期更新技术工具箱，在学术实践中培养\"方法自觉\"意识。

2])\n底层层，在后续的epoch中逐渐解冻这些层，以让模型能够更好地适应特定任务。\n数据相关术语与知识\n标注数据（AnnotatedData）\n标注数据是指带有标签的训练数据，用于微调模型以完成特定任务。对于不同的下游任务，标注数据的形式也不同。在文本分类任务中，标注数据是文本及其对应的类别标签；在命名实体识别任务中，标注数据是文本以及每个词对应的实体标签。标注数据的质量和数量对微调的效果有着重要影响。高质量的标注数据可以帮助模型学习到更准确的特征，而足够数量的标注数据可以避免过拟合。获取标注数据通常需要人工标注或使用半自动标注工具。\n数据增强（DataAugmentation）\n数据增强是指通过对原始数据进行变换，生成更多的训练数据的技术。在自然语言处理中，常见的数据增强方法包括同义词替换、插入、删除、回译等。例如，在文本分类任务中，可以将文本中的一些词替换为同义词，或者将文本翻译成另一种语言再翻译回来，从而得到新的训练样本。数据增强可以增加训练数据的多样性，提高模型的泛化能力。特别是在标注数据有限的情况下，数据增强可以有效地缓解数据不足的问题。\n数据划分（DataPartitioning）\n数据划分是指将标注数据划分为训练集、验证集和测试集的过程。训练集用于模型的训练，验证集用于在训练过程中评估模型的性能，选择最优的模型参数，测试集用于最终评估模型的泛化能力。常见的数据划分比例是训练集：验证集：测试集=70%：15%：15%或80%：10%：10%。合理的数据划分可以确保模型在训练过程中不出现过拟合，并且能够准确地评估模型的性能。\n小样本学习（FewShotLearning）\n小样本学习是指在仅有少量标注数据的情况下进行模型训练的技术。在实际应用中，获取大量的标注数据可能是困难和昂贵的，因此小样本学习具有重要的意义。在大模型微调中，小样本学习可以通过利用预训练模型的知识，结合一些特殊的训练策略，如元学习、迁移学习等，在少量标注数据上取得较好的性能。例如，使用预训练模型的特征表示，然后在少量标注数据上进行微调，或者使用元学习算法在不同的小样本任务上进行训练和学习。\n训练相关术语与知识\n学习率（LearningRate）\n学习率是优化算法中的一个重要超参数，它控制着模型参数更新的步长。在微调过程中，合适的学习率非常关键。如果学习率过大，模型的参数更新会过快，可能导致模型无法收敛或在最优解附近震荡；如果学习率过小，模型的训练速度会很慢，需要更多的训练时间才能达到较好的性能。常见的学习率调整策略包括固定学习率、学习率衰减（如按epoch衰减、按验证集性能衰减）等。例如，在训练的前几个epoch使用较大的学习率，随着训练的进行逐渐减小学习率，以让模型在不同阶段都能有效地学习。\n优化器（Optimizer）\n优化器是用于更新模型参数的算法，其目的是最小化损失函数。常见的优化器包括随机梯度下降（StochasticGradientDescent,SGD）、Adagrad、Adadelta、Adam等。不同的优化器具有不同的特点和适用场景。Adam优化器结合了Adagrad和RMSProp的优点，能够自适应地调整每个参数的学习率，在很多情况下表现较好。在大模型微调中，选择合适的优化器可以提高训练效率和模型性能。\n损失函数（LossFunction）\n损失函数用于衡量模型预测结果与真实标签之间的差异。在不同的下游任务中，使用的损失函数也不同。在文本分类任务中，常用的损失函数是交叉熵损失函数；在回归任务中，常用的损失函数是均方误差损失函数。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

大模型聊天过程分析\n我打开AI聊天窗口https://chat.deepseek.com，发送我的Query：\n1.1 流程浅析\n当我们开始一个LLM聊天对话，输入问题时，实际上大模型托管服务有内置的上下文信息，在我们输入信息，按下发送按钮时，大模型收到的是内置上下文 + 系统服务Prompt + 用户输入信息。\n大模型经过神经网络的概率统计（权重拟合)得到下一个要说的词，通过流式响应逐个词丢回会话窗口，用户就能看到大模型“正在打字”和我们聊天。“打字”的速度就是大模型响应的速度，通常看描述LLM性能的一个指标N token/s。\n1.2 原理浅析\n本质就是从输入的 tokens 推测下一个 token 的出现概率，将可能性较高的作为输出token，再将得到的token添加到输入中，直到满足结束条件（上下文长度限制、结束符以较高概率出现、用户定义的停止条件、概率阈值与采样策略、模型架构的隐式结束符）。所以LLM本质上是一个具有统计概率的知识记忆模糊的知识回顾系统，也可简称概率性复读机。那么这个回顾系统是怎么实现的呢，“zip文件”怎么得来的？构建一个现代的LLM三个步骤：**预训练、后训练（SFT）和强化学习（RL\\RLHF)**。\n1.3 预训练\n在预训练过程中，需要有原始数据和验证数据，所以通常可以将数据集分为两份，例如90%用于训练，10%用于验证（具体比例可能因任务调整）。\n1.3.1 数据集\n数据集生成流程：\n列举主流网站的URL\n有害网站URL过滤，垃圾站点、成人内容等\n从URL网站响应的富文本提取文字内容\n文本语言过滤，如仅针保留英文或者中文内容，在huggingface上数据集语言分布前5如下图：\nGopher 过滤，去除无意义、低信息量或有害内容（如垃圾文本、暴力、偏见等）\nMinHash 去重，用于快速检测并移除数据集中的重复或近似重复的文本片段（如文档、段落或句子）。其核心目的是减少数据冗余，避免模型因重复数据过拟合或偏向高频内容，同时节省计算资源。\nC4 过滤，C4（Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus） 数据集进行清洗和筛选的步骤，旨在从原始网页文本中提取高质量、多样化的语料，同时去除噪声、重复和低效内容。\nCustom Filters（自定义过滤器）目标是针对通用过滤方法（如MinHash去重、C4/Gopher过滤）无法覆盖的领域特殊性问题，进行更精细化的数据质量控制。\nPII Removal（个人身份信息移除） 是指从原始数据中识别并删除或匿名化 个人身份信息（Personally Identifiable Information, PII） 的关键步骤，旨在保护用户隐私、遵守数据保护法规（如GDPR、CCPA），并降低模型泄露敏感信息的风险。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 4\nCitation: [long_context:

，因此不能够理解并遵循人类自然语言形式的指令。\n要进一步用于下游任务需要再构建 问题与答案的数据集 进行指令微调，在通用语义表示的基础上，适配下游任务特性。\n从训练方式的角度来看，指令微调与预训练大体上较为相似，不过 指令微调的目标函数往往只是针对输出部分来计算损失 。\n（1）指令微调数据集\n相比预训练数据集量级小的多，根据OpenAI公开消息，指令微调阶段也仅仅使用数万条数据。\n构成：文本对，包含“指令输入”与“答案输出”两个关键部分。\n构建方法：手动构建、现有数据集转换、自动构建以及综合模式。都是一个学习点\n数据影响评估：数据质量、数据多样性、数据对结果影响评估等。\n开源数据集：通用、特定领域。\n（2）指令微调\n全量微调：微调全部参数\n高效微调：微调部分参数，旨在仅训练少量参数就使模型适应下游任务。例如 LoRA大语言模型的低秩适配器 ，算法结构如下：\nLoRA 算法不仅在 RoBERTa、DeBERTa、GPT-3 等大语言模型上取得了很好的效果，还应用到了 Stable Diffusion 等视觉大模型中，可以用小成本达到微调大语言模型的目的。引起了企业界和研究界的广泛关注。\n还有一些变体： AdaLoRA、QLoRA、IncreLoRA 及 LoRA-FA 等。\n（3）上下文窗口扩展\n你肯定遇到过经过多轮对话后，AI抽风记不住之前的要求，开始胡乱编撰。随着更多长文本建模需求的出现，多轮对话、长文档摘要等任务在实际应用中越来越多。\n常见上下文窗口扩展技术：\n增加上下文窗口的微调 ：采用直接的方式，即通过使用一个更大的上下文窗口来微调现有的预训练 Transformer，以适应长文本建模需求。\n具备外推能力的位置编码 ：改进的位置编码，如 ALiBi[240]、LeX[241] 等能够实现一定程度上的长度外推。这意味着它们可以在小的上下文窗口上进行训练，在大的上下文窗口上进行推理。\n插值法 ：将超出上下文窗口的位置编码通过插值法压缩到预训练的上下文窗口中。\n3、强化学习（RL）\n有监督微调后的模型初步具备回答指令的能力，但有2个缺陷：\n麻烦：需要构建海量指令-答案对数据集，高质量回复标注需耗费高昂人力成本；\n难以适应多样性：交叉熵损失函数要求模型输出与标准答案逐字匹配，既无法适应自然语言的表达多样性，也难以解决输出对输入微小变动的敏感性。\n针对以上，所以补充上 强化学习 ！\n强化学习（RL）研究的是智能体与环境交互的问题，其目标是使智能体在复杂且不确定的环境中最大化奖励。\n2种演进方向：\n基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF） ：模型自主探索更优的回复策略，并使得模型回复与人类偏好和价值观对齐。 面向深度推理的强化学习 ：以 OpenAI 的 O 系列模型和 DeepSeek的 R 系列为代表，通过答案校验引导模型进行多步推理。这类方法将复杂问题分解为长思维链（Chain-of-Thought）的决策序列，在数学证明、代码生成等场景中展现出超越监督学习的推理能力。 比之有监督学习：RL摆脱局部最优束缚、突破数据覆盖的认知边界、复杂系统长期价值建模。\n算法方法：\n传统方法（如 Q-learning） ：通常基于“价值函数”间接优化策略——先评估动作的价值，再选择最优动作。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 7\nCitation: [long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk

》课程，课程注重理论思想与代码实践相结合，最终带你从0到1制作自己的mini-ChatGPT。\n生成式预训练语言模型：理论与实战\nLLM分布式训练并行技术\n近年来，随着Transformer、MOE架构的提出，使得深度学习模型轻松突破上万亿规模参数，传统的单机单卡模式已经无法满足超大模型进行训练的要求。因此，我们需要基于单机多卡、甚至是多机多卡进行分布式大模型的训练。\n而利用AI集群，使深度学习算法更好地从大量数据中高效地训练出性能优良的大模型是分布式机器学习的首要目标。为了实现该目标，一般需要根据硬件资源与数据/模型规模的匹配情况，考虑对计算任务、训练数据和模型进行划分，从而进行分布式训练。因此，分布式训练相关技术值得我们进行深入分析其背后的机理。\n下面主要对大模型进行分布式训练的并行技术进行讲解，本系列大体分九篇文章进行讲解。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

3])\nam优化器结合了Adagrad和RMSProp的优点，能够自适应地调整每个参数的学习率，在很多情况下表现较好。在大模型微调中，选择合适的优化器可以提高训练效率和模型性能。\n损失函数（LossFunction）\n损失函数用于衡量模型预测结果与真实标签之间的差异。在不同的下游任务中，使用的损失函数也不同。在文本分类任务中，常用的损失函数是交叉熵损失函数；在回归任务中，常用的损失函数是均方误差损失函数。损失函数的选择直接影响模型的训练目标和性能。通过最小化损失函数，模型可以不断调整参数，使其预测结果更接近真实标签。\n过拟合（Overfitting）\n过拟合是指模型在训练集上表现很好，但在测试集或新数据上表现较差的现象。在大模型微调中，过拟合是一个常见的问题。过拟合通常是由于模型过于复杂，而训练数据量不足或模型训练时间过长导致的。为了避免过拟合，可以采用正则化方法（如L1和L2正则化）、早停策略（EarlyStopping）、数据增强等方法。早停策略是指在验证集上的性能不再提升时停止训练，以避免模型在训练集上过度学习。\n欠拟合（Underfitting）\n欠拟合是指模型在训练集和测试集上的表现都较差的现象。欠拟合通常是由于模型过于简单，无法学习到数据中的复杂特征，或者训练时间过短，模型还没有充分学习到数据的特征。为了避免欠拟合，可以增加模型的复杂度，如增加模型的层数或神经元数量，或者增加训练的epoch数，让模型有更多的时间学习。\n模型架构与技术相关知识\n迁移学习（TransferLearning）\n迁移学习是指将在一个任务上学习到的知识迁移到另一个相关任务上的技术。大模型微调就是一种典型的迁移学习方法。通过在大规模无监督数据上预训练模型，学习到通用的语言知识，然后将这些知识迁移到特定的下游任务上。迁移学习可以减少在特定任务上的训练时间和数据需求，提高模型的效率和性能。例如，在图像识别领域，也广泛应用了迁移学习，将在大规模图像数据集上预训练的模型迁移到特定的图像分类任务上。\n多任务学习（MultiTaskLearning）\n多任务学习是指同时在多个相关任务上训练模型的技术。在大模型微调中，多任务学习可以让模型在不同的任务之间共享特征，提高模型的泛化能力和效率。例如，可以同时在文本分类和命名实体识别任务上训练模型，让模型学习到更丰富的语言特征。多任务学习通常通过设计合适的损失函数，将多个任务的\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

 250,000  （250K）。\n1.3.4 数据分片\n将大规模训练数据集划分为多个逻辑或物理片段（Shard）的技术，目的是实现高效的数据并行处理和分布式训练。\n数据分片的核心作用：\n解决内存与存储限制 ：单个节点无法加载全部数据，分片后每个节点仅处理部分数据。 并行加速训练 ：不同分片由不同计算设备并行处理（如GPU），缩短训练时间。 容错性 ：单个分片损坏或失败时，只需重新处理该分片，而非整个数据集。\n我们知道数据集是一张表，所以数据分片的方式方法和传统结构化数据分片类似，但这里要结合训练过程的实际情况做调整，数据分片常见方法：\n静态分片，预先规划好分片，每个GPU固定处理指定分片，优点实现简单，缺点是实际训练过程中可能导致GPU负载不平衡，因为数据集中的每一行长度是不同的，所以会导致数据倾斜。 动态分片，训练过程中动态分配数据（如通过中央调度器或分布式文件系统），优点：自动平衡负载，适应数据异构性。缺点：实现复杂，需额外协调开销（如Apache Spark或Ray框架）。 分片与数据管道的结合，流水线加载：当一个GPU处理当前分片时，异步预加载下一个分片（隐藏I/O延迟）；格式优化：分片常存储为高效二进制格式（如TFRecord、HDF5），加速读取。\n1.3.5 模型架构选择\n当前主流LLM通常是采用Transformer结构，包含自主力(Self-Attention)和多头注意力(Multi-Head Attention)的注意力层、前馈神经网络(FFN)，注意力层+FFN等模块组成一层，需要确定模型的层数和参数量。\n主流架构 ：Transformer（基于自注意力机制），常见变体：\nDecoder-only （GPT系列）：适合生成任务，单向注意力掩码。 Encoder-decoder （T5、BART）：适合翻译等序列到序列任务。\n规模参数 ：\n层数（L）：12-100+（如GPT-3 davinci版本包含96层） 隐藏层维度（d_model）：768-12,288 注意力头数（h）：12-128\nTransformer结构 ：\n自注意力机制 ：计算输入序列中每个位置的关联权重（如多头注意力）。 前馈网络（FFN） ：每个注意力层后接非线性变换。 层数与参数量 ：例如，GPT-3有1750亿参数，包含96层Transformer块。\n1.3.6 训练任务设计、执行和优化\n预训练任务设计\n自监督学习 ：无需人工标注，通过文本自身生成监督信号。\n因果语言建模（CLM） ：预测下一个Token，目标函数：\n掩码语言建模（MLM） ：随机遮盖部分Token并预测（如BERT），遮盖比例通常15%。\n混合目标 ：如UniLM结合双向和单向预测。\n训练执行\n训练过程\n分布式训练，并行策略执行、通信优化，每一轮训练（单步训练）流程包括：\n数据加载与预处理，可以是分布式数据加载，或动态批次构建。 前向传播（含激活重计算） 反向传播 梯度同步（数据并行） 参数更新（含梯度裁剪）\nTransformer结构的训练通常需要经过上万轮的训练，即上万个训练步数，训练时会充分利用GPU并行的特性，在分布式训练中并行，包括数据并行、模型并行、张量并行、流水线并行，且总GPU数 = 数据并行度 × 模型并行度。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

比之有监督学习：RL摆脱局部最优束缚、突破数据覆盖的认知边界、复杂系统长期价值建模。\n算法方法：\n传统方法（如 Q-learning） ：通常基于“价值函数”间接优化策略——先评估动作的价值，再选择最优动作。 策略梯度（Policy Gradient）方法 ：摒弃了“先估值再决策”的中间步骤，而是将策略本身参数化（例如用神经网络表示），直接通过梯度上升优化策略参数，让智能体更倾向于选择能带来高回报的动作。\n 学习时可从从策略梯度的基础概念出发，回顾经典算法如  REINFORCE，PPO  等，并讨论在大模型时代流行的  GRPO，RLOO  等方法。\n开源框架：\n字节跳动与香港大学联合开源的 RL 框架 verl（HybridFlow），为大模型强化学习训练带来了创新性的解决方案，有效解决了传统 RL/RLHF 系统灵活性和效率不足的问题。\n开源数据集：\nSummarize from Feedback：OpenAI 在2020年就将RLHF技术引入摘要生成，该数据集分为两部分：对比部分和轴向部分。对比部分共计 17.9 万条数据，标注者从两个摘要中选择一个更好的摘要。轴向部分则有共计 1.5 万条数据，使用 Likert 量表为摘要的质量评分。对比部分仅有训练和验证划分，而轴向部分仅有测试和验证划分 WebGPT的人类反馈数据集：来指导模型提升长文档问答能力，该数据集包含在 WebGPT 项目结束时被标记为适合奖励建模的所有对比数据，总计 1.9 万条数据。 其他：Anthropic 的HH-RLHF数据集、Stanford Human Preferences（SHP）数据集。\n4、推理效率优化（模型、训练、推理）\n大模型的推理过程与其他深度学习模型（如 BERT、ResNet 等）非常不同，BERT 的执行时间通常是确定且高度可预测的。\n但在大语言模型的推理过程中，虽然每次迭代执行时间具有确定性，但 迭代次数（输出长度）是未知的 。\n影响效率指标的关键因素：计算成本、内存访问成本、内存使用情况。\n 核心原因：模型规模、自注意力机制（计算复杂度核心来源）、解码方法。\n效率优化方法：\n模型优化：\n优化模型结构 （ 高效 FFN 设计、注意力机制优化、MoE 架构设计、Transformer 代替架构设计 ）\n模型压缩 （ 修改模型的数据表示（例如量化）、改变其架构（例如稀疏化、结构优化等）、知识蒸馏 来提高推理效率）\n低精度训练：\n前主流训练框架（例如 Megatron-LM、MetaSeq 和 Colossal-AI）仍采用 FP32 全精度或混合精度的 FP16/BF16 策略。\n随着 Nvidia H100 GPU 的推出， FP8  正逐渐成为下一代低精度数据表示的主流格式。面临 数据下溢或上溢问题 。\n推理优化： 算法级 （多模型推测解码、KV-cache 优化）、 系统级 （模型/硬件并行化策略、显存优化、调度优化、网络请求优化、采样解码加速等）。\n5、部署与应用\n三层工作：\n基础层：大模型、深度学习框架（Pytorch/Tensorflow）、硬件算力支持（GPU/TPU集群）。 部署层：模型压缩/量化/剪枝、推理优化（TensorRT、ONNX Runtime）、部署架构（云原生/嵌入式边缘端）、服务化封装（API网关、负载均衡）。\n\n\n============================================================\nCITATION GUIDANCE:\nWhen citing information from long_context.json, use the format:\n

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu.

We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3).

Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

For the DPO and IPO loss,\nthe directions of the updating signals are identical.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

By observing the last row, where the model is trained using DPO, it is clear that the push-down\npressure is dominant. Because almost all SignDeltauo terms have big negative values, and the only\npositive one is y+\n\nu (roughly 0.5, much smaller than other positive values in the SFT cases).\n\nWe also provide some intermediate quantities in Figure 9 to further validate our analysis.

The second\none is for SFT and the third one is for DPO. It is clear that log π(y∗) and log π(y∗)C changes faster in the\nDPO case, which matches our observations in the fourth panel of Figure 3 well.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.)

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first. With Equation (32) and (33), zt+1 can be recursively written\ndown as:\n\nand pt\n\ni\n\nzt+1 = (wt+1)⊤ϕ(x)\n\nϕ(x)\n\n= (cid:0)wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤(cid:1)⊤\n= (wt)⊤ϕ(x) − η (cid:0)ϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤(cid:1)⊤\n= zt − η∥ϕ(x)∥2\n= zt − η′(pt − ey)\n\n2(pt − ey)\n\nϕ(x)\n\n(36)\n\nwhere η′ ≜ η∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 is the equivalent learning rate that depends on the norm of feature representation. Note\nthat z, p and ey are all length-V vectors and y is an integer ranging from 1 to V . Then we can write down\neach zt+1\n\nas:\n\ni\n\nzt+1\ni =\n\n(cid:40)\n\ni + η′,\ni − η′pt\nzt\ni − η′pt\nzt\ni,\n\nif i = y\n\nif i ̸= y\n\n(37)\n\nThen, we can combine the definition of Softmax function and write down different pt+1\nCase 1 where i = y, we have:\n\ni\n\ncase-by-case.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35).

Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value.

Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1.

Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al.

The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu .

Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y.

Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Sutherland（University of British Columbia & Amii）  \n发表会议：ICLR 2025  \n论文链接：https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM  \n研究背景：  \n随着大语言模型（Large Language Models，LLMs）愈发广泛应用，其在各种自然语言任务中的表现令人瞩目。实际部署的要求促使学者研究LLM微调环节（如SFT、DPO等），以期实现更优的人类指令对齐及偏好匹配【pdf.pdf, Abstract】。论文主要通过“学习动力学”（Learning Dynamics）视角，系统分析了不同微调技术在模型输出、优化过程与工程实践中的表现机制与特殊现象。\n\n（二）核心内容摘要\n\n1. **研究目标与动机**  \n本论文旨在揭示大模型微调过程中，单个训练样本对其它样本预测的迭代性影响，剖析微调步骤中响应概率的动态累积。研究聚焦于“指令微调（SFT）”和“偏好微调（DPO）”等主流算法，尝试用统一的数学框架解释幻觉（hallucination）、输出置信度下降（squeezing effect）、重复模式（repeater）等LLM微调中的特殊现象。进一步提出理论依据以优化模型对齐流程，提高工程实用性和可靠性【pdf.pdf, Abstract】【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 2】。\n\n2. **方法框架与技术路线**  \n论文提出逐步分解参数变化对模型输出的影响机制（learning dynamics），采用Taylor展开和梯度下降原理，建立了LLM微调中每一步模型预测变化的定量表达式。将此理论迁移至SFT、DPO等算法，统一解释“输出把概率挤压到极少数token”、“幻觉现象被放大”等微调常见问题【pdf.pdf, Section 3】【long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk 1】。\n\n3. **实验设计与结论**  \n论文分别在Antropic-HH、UltraFeedback等通用数据集以及多种主流模型（如Pythia、Qwen等）上验证了理论预测。试验内容涵盖：  \n- 多类响应类型变化趋势跟踪（如同义/无关/拒绝响应等）；\n- SFT、DPO不同阶段响应置信度的曲线分析；\n- “幻觉”与“squeezing effect”产生的条件与影响\n  \n结论包括：  \n- 微调能显著提高模型对高质量响应的置信度，但也会提升“幻觉”类内容的输出概率【pdf.pdf, Section 4.1】；\n- DPO等引入大负梯度的算法在概率分布低谷区会造成整体输出置信度下降、重复生成等问题（squeezing effect）；\n- 提出用训练数据扩展、多样化对比样本等方法有效缓解上述负面影响，提升微调后模型的实际表现【pdf.pdf, Section 4.3】。\n\n（三）关键技术解析\n\n1. **Transformer架构原理**  \nTransformer以自注意力（Self-Attention）和多头注意力（Multi-Head Attention）为核心，能够高效建模序列全局依赖，极大提升了大模型的可扩展性和理解能力。其编码-解码模块，通过层叠前馈神经网络（FFN）和归一化操作，使模型能够处理复杂上下文。主流LLM如GPT、BERT等均基于Transformer演变而来，采用因果掩码（causal masking）以支持自回归推理【long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk 3】【pdf.pdf, Section 3.1】。\n\n2. **主流微调算法机制**  \n- **SFT（指令微调）**：以NLL（负对数似然）损失函数最小化为目标，使模型最大化对“优选响应”序列概率分布。SFT能有效提升针对特定指令的输出质量，却可能引发输出迁移和“幻觉”现象，即生成其它任务场景片段或无关内容【pdf.pdf, Section 4.1】【long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝\", chunk 2】。\n- **DPO（偏好优化）**：通过对模型“优选响应”和“拒绝响应”的KL对比优化，强化优选，削弱次选。DPO强调模型对人类偏好和价值对齐，但长期训练易导致所有响应均信心下降，“概率挤压”现象严重（squeezing effect）【pdf.pdf, Section 3.2】【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 2】。\n- **优化与正则手段**：Adam、SGD等自适应优化器，辅助以正则化、early stopping、多样数据增强，能有效缓解过拟合、提升泛化能力【long_context: \"大模型微调常用术语与知识总结-20250902102413.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 2】【chunk 3】。\n\n3. **学习动力学理论与特殊现象解释**  \n论文创新性地利用“学习动力学分解”，追踪每一训练样本对大模型全局分布的链式影响，明确解释：  \n- 为什么幻觉现象在微调后被放大，以及响应迁移的内部机制；\n- “squeezing effect”本质上为概率分布在“低置信度token”区域受负梯度影响被迫集中，导致输出多样性/置信度急剧下降，甚至出现重复、退化【pdf.pdf, Section 3.3】【Section 4.2】【Section E】；\n- 提出拓展SFT训练集、引入对比多样样本可显著缓解负面现象，为工程落地提供实践性优化路径。\n\n4. **工程难点与案例**  \n报告总结了数据标注、增强、迁移学习、高效参数微调（如LoRA、QLoRA等）的技术难点与经验，并结合分布式训练和推理效率优化策略，阐释了大模型实际落地的系统瓶颈与解决思路【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 2】【chunk 3】【long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝\", chunk 3】。\n\n（四）视频补充要点\n\n本次AI TIME主办、任毅领讲的ICLR 2025预讲会（见所附视频【video.mp4】分析），系统补充了论文理论核心与工程案例，主要内容包括：\n\n1. 由梯度下降、泰勒展开等数理基础推导学习动力学原理，并以MNIST小模型实例过渡至LLM的SFT、DPO复杂流程，帮助初学者从直观案例建立理论理解；\n2. 演讲重点解读了SFT、DPO等主流微调策略下模型不同响应类型实际表现与曲线演化过程，强调“幻觉”在SFT阶段的突出与风险，并配以实验数据和可视化讲解；\n3. 解析了squeezing effect带来的概率分布异常，提醒工程实践中需针对大负梯度影响采取措施。建议结合实际数据和数学曲线进行逐步验证与掌握；\n4. 给出的学习路线建议：初学者宜先从简化任务（如MNIST学习动力学）、梯度原理入手，再对照大模型全流程与工程场景深化，理论结合工程、关注异常现象，并查阅权威前沿论文对照理论与现象【video.mp4分析】；\n5. 视频明确推荐论文原文为深化学习的权威资料，强调对Transformer底层Attention机制、loss动态、负梯度机制的专门掌握有助于工程与理论晋阶。\n\n（五）参考资料与权威出处标注  \n- 主要技术方法、理论来源及实验细节：【pdf.pdf, 各章节明确标注】  \n- 工程技术与算法背景：【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 1,2,3】【long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝\", chunk 2,3】【long_context: \"大模型微调常用术语与知识总结-20250902102413.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 2,3】  \n- Transformer原理与算法机制详解：【long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk 3】  \n- 视频分析补充：【video.mp4分析】\n\n（六）结语  \n本报告紧密结合ICLR 2025最新论文与权威视频资源，从理论原理、算法实现到工程案例，多角度、分阶段解读了“大模型微调学习动力学”前沿研究，揭示了幻觉、squeezing effect等关键现象背后的本质机制，并提出了实用的优化与学习建议。报告结构化呈现内容，针对初学者需求，强调理论与实验、策略与实践相结合，便于深入系统掌握大模型核心技术与实际应用路径。\n}",

Sutherland（University of British Columbia & Amii）  \n发表会议：ICLR 2025  \n论文链接：https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM  \n研究背景：  \n随着大语言模型（Large Language Models，LLMs）愈发广泛应用，其在各种自然语言任务中的表现令人瞩目。实际部署的要求促使学者研究LLM微调环节（如SFT、DPO等），以期实现更优的人类指令对齐及偏好匹配【pdf.pdf, Abstract】。论文主要通过“学习动力学”（Learning Dynamics）视角，系统分析了不同微调技术在模型输出、优化过程与工程实践中的表现机制与特殊现象。\n\n（二）核心内容摘要\n\n1. **研究目标与动机**  \n本论文旨在揭示大模型微调过程中，单个训练样本对其它样本预测的迭代性影响，剖析微调步骤中响应概率的动态累积。研究聚焦于“指令微调（SFT）”和“偏好微调（DPO）”等主流算法，尝试用统一的数学框架解释幻觉（hallucination）、输出置信度下降（squeezing effect）、重复模式（repeater）等LLM微调中的特殊现象。进一步提出理论依据以优化模型对齐流程，提高工程实用性和可靠性【pdf.pdf, Abstract】【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 2】。\n\n2. **方法框架与技术路线**  \n论文提出逐步分解参数变化对模型输出的影响机制（learning dynamics），采用Taylor展开和梯度下降原理，建立了LLM微调中每一步模型预测变化的定量表达式。将此理论迁移至SFT、DPO等算法，统一解释“输出把概率挤压到极少数token”、“幻觉现象被放大”等微调常见问题【pdf.pdf, Section 3】【long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk 1】。\n\n3. **实验设计与结论**  \n论文分别在Antropic-HH、UltraFeedback等通用数据集以及多种主流模型（如Pythia、Qwen等）上验证了理论预测。试验内容涵盖：  \n- 多类响应类型变化趋势跟踪（如同义/无关/拒绝响应等）；\n- SFT、DPO不同阶段响应置信度的曲线分析；\n- “幻觉”与“squeezing effect”产生的条件与影响\n  \n结论包括：  \n- 微调能显著提高模型对高质量响应的置信度，但也会提升“幻觉”类内容的输出概率【pdf.pdf, Section 4.1】；\n- DPO等引入大负梯度的算法在概率分布低谷区会造成整体输出置信度下降、重复生成等问题（squeezing effect）；\n- 提出用训练数据扩展、多样化对比样本等方法有效缓解上述负面影响，提升微调后模型的实际表现【pdf.pdf, Section 4.3】。\n\n（三）关键技术解析\n\n1. **Transformer架构原理**  \nTransformer以自注意力（Self-Attention）和多头注意力（Multi-Head Attention）为核心，能够高效建模序列全局依赖，极大提升了大模型的可扩展性和理解能力。其编码-解码模块，通过层叠前馈神经网络（FFN）和归一化操作，使模型能够处理复杂上下文。主流LLM如GPT、BERT等均基于Transformer演变而来，采用因果掩码（causal masking）以支持自回归推理【long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk 3】【pdf.pdf, Section 3.1】。\n\n2. **主流微调算法机制**  \n- **SFT（指令微调）**：以NLL（负对数似然）损失函数最小化为目标，使模型最大化对“优选响应”序列概率分布。SFT能有效提升针对特定指令的输出质量，却可能引发输出迁移和“幻觉”现象，即生成其它任务场景片段或无关内容【pdf.pdf, Section 4.1】【long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝\", chunk 2】。\n- **DPO（偏好优化）**：通过对模型“优选响应”和“拒绝响应”的KL对比优化，强化优选，削弱次选。DPO强调模型对人类偏好和价值对齐，但长期训练易导致所有响应均信心下降，“概率挤压”现象严重（squeezing effect）【pdf.pdf, Section 3.2】【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 2】。\n- **优化与正则手段**：Adam、SGD等自适应优化器，辅助以正则化、early stopping、多样数据增强，能有效缓解过拟合、提升泛化能力【long_context: \"大模型微调常用术语与知识总结-20250902102413.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 2】【chunk 3】。\n\n3. **学习动力学理论与特殊现象解释**  \n论文创新性地利用“学习动力学分解”，追踪每一训练样本对大模型全局分布的链式影响，明确解释：  \n- 为什么幻觉现象在微调后被放大，以及响应迁移的内部机制；\n- “squeezing effect”本质上为概率分布在“低置信度token”区域受负梯度影响被迫集中，导致输出多样性/置信度急剧下降，甚至出现重复、退化【pdf.pdf, Section 3.3】【Section 4.2】【Section E】；\n- 提出拓展SFT训练集、引入对比多样样本可显著缓解负面现象，为工程落地提供实践性优化路径。\n\n4. **工程难点与案例**  \n报告总结了数据标注、增强、迁移学习、高效参数微调（如LoRA、QLoRA等）的技术难点与经验，并结合分布式训练和推理效率优化策略，阐释了大模型实际落地的系统瓶颈与解决思路【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 2】【chunk 3】【long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝\", chunk 3】。\n\n（四）视频补充要点\n\n本次AI TIME主办、任毅领讲的ICLR 2025预讲会（见所附视频【video.mp4】分析），系统补充了论文理论核心与工程案例，主要内容包括：\n\n1. 由梯度下降、泰勒展开等数理基础推导学习动力学原理，并以MNIST小模型实例过渡至LLM的SFT、DPO复杂流程，帮助初学者从直观案例建立理论理解；\n2. 演讲重点解读了SFT、DPO等主流微调策略下模型不同响应类型实际表现与曲线演化过程，强调“幻觉”在SFT阶段的突出与风险，并配以实验数据和可视化讲解；\n3. 解析了squeezing effect带来的概率分布异常，提醒工程实践中需针对大负梯度影响采取措施。建议结合实际数据和数学曲线进行逐步验证与掌握；\n4. 给出的学习路线建议：初学者宜先从简化任务（如MNIST学习动力学）、梯度原理入手，再对照大模型全流程与工程场景深化，理论结合工程、关注异常现象，并查阅权威前沿论文对照理论与现象【video.mp4分析】；\n5. 视频明确推荐论文原文为深化学习的权威资料，强调对Transformer底层Attention机制、loss动态、负梯度机制的专门掌握有助于工程与理论晋阶。\n\n（五）参考资料与权威出处标注  \n- 主要技术方法、理论来源及实验细节：【pdf.pdf, 各章节明确标注】  \n- 工程技术与算法背景：【long_context: \"如何系统的入门大模型？\", chunk 1,2,3】【long_context: \"AI大模型全栈学习指南：零基础入门到精通系统性框架(全网最全)建议收藏！人工智能_模型优化师-北京朝\", chunk 2,3】【long_context: \"大模型微调常用术语与知识总结-20250902102413.docx-原创力文档\", chunk 2,3】  \n- Transformer原理与算法机制详解：【long_context: \"LLM学习笔记：最好的学习方法是带着问题去寻找答案_腾讯新闻\", chunk 3】  \n- 视频分析补充：【video.mp4分析】\n\n（六）结语  \n本报告紧密结合ICLR 2025最新论文与权威视频资源，从理论原理、算法实现到工程案例，多角度、分阶段解读了“大模型微调学习动力学”前沿研究，揭示了幻觉、squeezing effect等关键现象背后的本质机制，并提出了实用的优化与学习建议。报告结构化呈现内容，针对初学者需求，强调理论与实验、策略与实践相结合，便于深入系统掌握大模型核心技术与实际应用路径。\n}",
