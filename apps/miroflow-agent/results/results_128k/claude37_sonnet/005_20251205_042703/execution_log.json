Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y.

Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

    "system_prompt": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \n\nYou only have access to the tools provided below. You can only use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool in the user's next response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool-use informed by the result of the previous tool-use. Today is: 2025-12-05\n\n# Tool-Use Formatting Instructions \n\nTool-use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool-use is enclosed in <use_mcp_tool></use_mcp_tool> and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects to servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities. You can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool`.\n\nDescription: \nRequest to use a tool provided by a MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.\n\nParameters:\n- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the tool\n- tool_name: (required) The name of the tool to execute\n- arguments: (required) A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters, following the tool's input schema, quotes within string must be properly escaped, ensure it's valid JSON\n\nUsage:\n<use_mcp_tool>\n<server_name>server name here</server_name>\n<tool_name>tool name here</tool_name>\n<arguments>\n{\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\"param2\": \"value2 \\\"escaped string\\\"\"\n}\n</arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Tool-use must be placed **at the end** of your response, **top-level**, and not nested within other tags.\n- Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\nString and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, the user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Thorough Analysis Requirement**:\n- For complex tasks involving document analysis, literature review, or report generation, you MUST work through **at least 7-8 turns** of analysis before producing the final answer.\n- Do NOT rush to conclusions after only 2-3 turns. Take time to:\n  - Explore different aspects of the source materials\n  - Perform multiple RAG searches with different keywords\n  - Cross-reference information from different sources\n  - Verify and validate findings\n  - Build a comprehensive understanding before synthesizing\n- Each turn should focus on a specific aspect or sub-goal\n- Only produce the final report after thorough multi-turn exploration\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. Each step must involve a single tool call, unless the task is already solved. \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, extract and summarize any partial information, patterns, constraints, or keywords that can help guide future steps.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. Do not include tool results in your response — the user will provide them.\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are a task-solving agent that uses tools step-by-step to answer the user's question. Your goal is to provide complete, accurate and well-reasoned answers using additional tools.\n\n",

        "content": "In this environment you have access to a set of tools you can use to answer the user's question. \n\nYou only have access to the tools provided below. You can only use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool in the user's next response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool-use informed by the result of the previous tool-use. Today is: 2025-12-05\n\n# Tool-Use Formatting Instructions \n\nTool-use is formatted using XML-style tags. The tool-use is enclosed in <use_mcp_tool></use_mcp_tool> and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) connects to servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities. You can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool`.\n\nDescription: \nRequest to use a tool provided by a MCP server. Each MCP server can provide multiple tools with different capabilities. Tools have defined input schemas that specify required and optional parameters.\n\nParameters:\n- server_name: (required) The name of the MCP server providing the tool\n- tool_name: (required) The name of the tool to execute\n- arguments: (required) A JSON object containing the tool's input parameters, following the tool's input schema, quotes within string must be properly escaped, ensure it's valid JSON\n\nUsage:\n<use_mcp_tool>\n<server_name>server name here</server_name>\n<tool_name>tool name here</tool_name>\n<arguments>\n{\n\"param1\": \"value1\",\n\"param2\": \"value2 \\\"escaped string\\\"\"\n}\n</arguments>\n</use_mcp_tool>\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Tool-use must be placed **at the end** of your response, **top-level**, and not nested within other tags.\n- Always adhere to this format for the tool use to ensure proper parsing and execution.\n\nString and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.\nHere are the functions available in JSONSchema format:\n\n## Server name: tool-python\n### Tool name: create_sandbox\nDescription: Create a linux sandbox.\n\nArgs:\n    timeout: Time in seconds before the sandbox is automatically shutdown.

Analyze the user's request and set clear, achievable sub-goals. Prioritize these sub-goals in a logical order.\n2. Start with a concise, numbered, step-by-step plan (e.g., 1., 2., 3.) outlining how you will solve the task before taking any action. Each sub-goal should correspond to a distinct step in your task-solving process.\n3. Work through these sub-goals sequentially. After each step, the user may provide tool-use feedback, reflect on the results and revise your plan if needed. If you encounter new information or challenges, adjust your approach accordingly. Revisit previous steps to ensure earlier sub-goals or clues have not been overlooked.\n4. You have access to a wide range of powerful tools. Use them strategically to accomplish each sub-goal.\n\n**IMPORTANT - Thorough Analysis Requirement**:\n- For complex tasks involving document analysis, literature review, or report generation, you MUST work through **at least 7-8 turns** of analysis before producing the final answer.\n- Do NOT rush to conclusions after only 2-3 turns. Take time to:\n  - Explore different aspects of the source materials\n  - Perform multiple RAG searches with different keywords\n  - Cross-reference information from different sources\n  - Verify and validate findings\n  - Build a comprehensive understanding before synthesizing\n- Each turn should focus on a specific aspect or sub-goal\n- Only produce the final report after thorough multi-turn exploration\n\n## Tool-Use Guidelines\n\n1. Each step must involve a single tool call, unless the task is already solved. \n2. Before each tool call:\n- Briefly summarize and analyze what is currently known.\n- Identify what is missing, uncertain, or unreliable.\n- Be concise; do not repeat the same analysis across steps.\n- Choose the most relevant tool for the current sub-goal, and explain why this tool is necessary at this point.\n- Verify whether all required parameters are either explicitly provided or can be clearly and reasonably inferred from context.\n- Do not guess or use placeholder values for missing inputs.\n- Skip optional parameters unless they are explicitly specified.\n3. All tool queries must include full, self-contained context. Tools do not retain memory between calls. Include all relevant information from earlier steps in each query.\n4. Avoid broad, vague, or speculative queries. Every tool call should aim to retrieve new, actionable information that clearly advances the task.\n5. Even if a tool result does not directly answer the question, extract and summarize any partial information, patterns, constraints, or keywords that can help guide future steps.\n\n## Tool-Use Communication Rules\n\n1. Do not include tool results in your response — the user will provide them.\n2. Do not present the final answer until the entire task is complete.\n3. Do not mention tool names.\n4. Do not engage in unnecessary back-and-forth or end with vague offers of help. Do not end your responses with questions or generic prompts.\n5. Do not use tools that do not exist.\n6. Unless otherwise requested, respond in the same language as the user's message.\n7. If the task does not require tool use, answer the user directly.\n\n\n\n# Agent Specific Objective\n\nYou are a task-solving agent that uses tools step-by-step to answer the user's question. Your goal is to provide complete, accurate and well-reasoned answers using additional tools.\n\n"

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

The presenter is **Yi Ren** from UBC, with research contributions from **Danica J. Sutherland** (UBC & Amii). The talk focuses on how LLMs adjust their predictions during finetuning, mathematical modeling of these changes, extensions to supervised finetuning (SFT), and the behavior of model gradients.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **Key Objects, People, or Elements**\\n\\n- **Presenter**: Visible in the top right corner in all frames; nameplate shows \\\"Yi Ren\\\".\\n- **Slides**: Rich with mathematical notation, charts, and diagrams.\\n- **Conference Branding**: ICLR 2025, Amii, UBC, and \\\"AI TIME\\\" logos; clear academic context.\\n- **QR Code**: Present in most slides, possibly for resources or contact.\\n- **Diagrams/Graphs**: Visual explanations of mathematical phenomena, model responses, and results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **Main Actions or Events**\\n\\n#### Frame-by-frame summary:\\n\\n- **Frame 1**: **Title Slide** – \\\"Learning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning\\\"; shows illustrative plots of model prediction changes.\\n- **Frame 2**: **Background/Introduction** – Explains learning dynamics using an MNIST example and sets up the question: how do model predictions change after learning a specific example?\\n- **Frame 3**: **Mathematical Details** – Presents equations describing log-probability changes; includes several plots/charts demonstrating convergence, early stage, and matrix relationships.\\n- **Frame 4**: **Extension to LLMs** – Adapts ideas from MNIST to Language Models; introduces responses and hypothetical similarities in responses using diagrams.\\n- **Frame 5**: **Results** – Shows graphs plotting chosen vs non-human responses, effect of SFT training on hallucination rates, and epoch progression.\\n- **Frame 6**: **Gradient Analysis** – Introduces the concept of negative gradients in LLM finetuning, with the SFT (Supervised Finetuning) equation.\\n- **Frame 7**: **Squeezing Effect** – Highlights a phenomenon where adding large negative gradients in specific regions \\\"squeezes\\\" the model's output, causing \\\"weird things\\\" (unexpected behaviors); illustrated with a probability plot.\\n- **Frame 8**: **Further Discussion** – Title suggests continuation (\\\"NG in RL\\\" – negative gradients in Reinforcement Learning); however, content is largely blank apart from the presenter.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **Notable Changes/Transitions Between Frames**\\n\\n- The presentation starts by setting up the problem context and then deepens into specific mathematical modeling and experimental results.\\n- There is a narrative shift from *simple examples* (MNIST) to *real-world LLMs*, including the unique challenges in language modeling.\\n- Technical depth increases: transitions from basic concepts to advanced observations such as \\\"squeezing effect\\\" and negative gradient impacts.\\n- Visualization transitions: from diagrams to empirical results and analytical charts, supporting the claims made.\\n- The talk appears to be structured into **three main parts**:\\n  1.

Topic**\\n- **Learning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning**\\n\\n#### **2. Covered Areas & Technical Concepts**\\n- **Learning dynamics**: How model predictions evolve during learning, with mathematical modeling (Taylor expansion, gradient descent).\\n- **Gradients and Squeezing**: Observation of unique behaviors when applying negative gradients in model probability landscapes, especially during SFT and RL (Reinforcement Learning).\\n- **Extension from MNIST to LLMs**: Starts with classic datasets/models and then generalizes theory to state-of-the-art language models that interact with human-annotated responses (such as GPT).\\n- **Empirical findings**: Includes the impact of training on chosen vs non-human responses, effects like hallucination increase, and convergence over training epochs.\\n- **Conclusions**: New theoretical insights into finetuning dynamics; identification of phenomena like the squeezing effect and potential issues (hallucinations, model instability).\\n\\n#### **3. Key Insights**\\n- Mathematical equations give a formal account of prediction changes post-training.\\n- The talk provides a bridge between theory (classic ML) and modern application (LLMs).\\n- \\\"Squeezing effect\\\" and negative gradients are positioned as critical concepts explaining certain unexpected LLM behaviors.\\n- Real data and plots back up the theoretical portions, increasing the validity of claims.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## **Final Assessment**\\n\\nThis video is a **technical presentation** (likely a research paper talk) at an academic conference.

[long_context: \"Transformer 学习笔记-CSDN博客\", chunk 0])\nTransformer 学习笔记-CSDN博客\n\n一、Transformer 的诞生背景与 优势\n传统序列 模型 （如  RNN /LSTM）受限于循环计算的串行特性，难以并行处理长序列，且长距离依赖问题显著。2017 年，Vaswani 等人在《Attention Is All You Need》中提出 Transformer 架构 ，彻底摒弃循环与 卷积 ，仅依赖注意力机制实现序列建模，成为 自然语言处理 领域的里程碑。\n两大显著优势：\n1.可捕获间隔较长的语义关联。\n2.充分利用分布式GPU进行并行训练，提升模型训练效率。\n二、Transformer 整体架构\nTransformer 总体架构包括四部分：输入、输出、编码器、解码器。\n（一）输入层\n1.词嵌入（Token Embedding）\n对输入的文本以单词为单位进行切分，再对单词序列编码，使用独热向量表达，再将独热向量映射为低维向量，可通过Word2Vec实现。\n2.位置编码（Positional Encoding）\n思路历程：整数位置编码→二进制位置编码→正弦位置编码\n为弥补注意力机制缺乏时序信息的缺陷，通过正弦 / 余弦函数生成位置向量，公式为：\n（二）、编码器（Encoder）\n由多个同样的编码器块组合而成\n1. 多头自注意力层（Multi-Head Self-Attention）\n注意力机制基本思想：“移动”量由 其他 词的意义(值)和其他词与当前词相关度决定。\n自注意力机制：\n（1）由每个编码器的输入向量生成三个向量，即查询向量、键向量和一个值向量。这三个向量是通过词嵌入与三个权重矩阵相乘后创建出来的。将以上所得到的查询向量、键向量、值向量组合起来就可以得到三个向量矩阵Query、Keys、Values。\n（2）计算得分。我们需要拿输入句子中的每个单词对目标单词进行打分。这些分数是通过所有输入句子的单词的键向量与“目标单词”的查询向量相点积来得到的。\n（3）将分数除以8(让梯度更稳定，这里也可以使用其它值),然后进行softmax处理。得到的softmax分数决定了每个单词对编码当下位置单词的贡献。\n（4）将每个值向量乘以对应softmax分数(以此来关注语义上相关的单词，并弱化不相关的单词),最后对加权值向量求和，即得到自注意力层在该位置的输出。\n多头自注意力机制：使用多组矩阵得到多组查询、键、值矩阵，然后每组分别计算得到一个Z矩阵，再得到最终的Z矩阵。这扩展了模型专注于不同位置的能力。\n2.前馈全连接层：Add（ 残差连接 ）、 Norm（层归一化）。\n（三）解码器（Decoder）\n解码器同样由N=6个层堆叠，每层包含三大子层：\n1. 掩码多头自注意力层\n掩码操作(mask)：计算注意力时，每一个新词(query)只能和之前出现的词进行相关运算。\n2. 多头自注意力层  与编码器相同\n3. 前馈 全连接层   与编码器相同\n（四）输出层\n由线性层和Softmax层串联而成。\n线性层：通过对上一步的线性变化得到指定维度的输出，也就是转换维度的作用.\nSoftmax层:使最后一维的向量中的数字缩放到0-1的概率值域内，并满足他们的和为1.\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

 250,000  （250K）。\n1.3.4 数据分片\n将大规模训练数据集划分为多个逻辑或物理片段（Shard）的技术，目的是实现高效的数据并行处理和分布式训练。\n数据分片的核心作用：\n解决内存与存储限制 ：单个节点无法加载全部数据，分片后每个节点仅处理部分数据。 并行加速训练 ：不同分片由不同计算设备并行处理（如GPU），缩短训练时间。 容错性 ：单个分片损坏或失败时，只需重新处理该分片，而非整个数据集。\n我们知道数据集是一张表，所以数据分片的方式方法和传统结构化数据分片类似，但这里要结合训练过程的实际情况做调整，数据分片常见方法：\n静态分片，预先规划好分片，每个GPU固定处理指定分片，优点实现简单，缺点是实际训练过程中可能导致GPU负载不平衡，因为数据集中的每一行长度是不同的，所以会导致数据倾斜。 动态分片，训练过程中动态分配数据（如通过中央调度器或分布式文件系统），优点：自动平衡负载，适应数据异构性。缺点：实现复杂，需额外协调开销（如Apache Spark或Ray框架）。 分片与数据管道的结合，流水线加载：当一个GPU处理当前分片时，异步预加载下一个分片（隐藏I/O延迟）；格式优化：分片常存储为高效二进制格式（如TFRecord、HDF5），加速读取。\n1.3.5 模型架构选择\n当前主流LLM通常是采用Transformer结构，包含自主力(Self-Attention)和多头注意力(Multi-Head Attention)的注意力层、前馈神经网络(FFN)，注意力层+FFN等模块组成一层，需要确定模型的层数和参数量。\n主流架构 ：Transformer（基于自注意力机制），常见变体：\nDecoder-only （GPT系列）：适合生成任务，单向注意力掩码。 Encoder-decoder （T5、BART）：适合翻译等序列到序列任务。\n规模参数 ：\n层数（L）：12-100+（如GPT-3 davinci版本包含96层） 隐藏层维度（d_model）：768-12,288 注意力头数（h）：12-128\nTransformer结构 ：\n自注意力机制 ：计算输入序列中每个位置的关联权重（如多头注意力）。 前馈网络（FFN） ：每个注意力层后接非线性变换。 层数与参数量 ：例如，GPT-3有1750亿参数，包含96层Transformer块。\n1.3.6 训练任务设计、执行和优化\n预训练任务设计\n自监督学习 ：无需人工标注，通过文本自身生成监督信号。\n因果语言建模（CLM） ：预测下一个Token，目标函数：\n掩码语言建模（MLM） ：随机遮盖部分Token并预测（如BERT），遮盖比例通常15%。\n混合目标 ：如UniLM结合双向和单向预测。\n训练执行\n训练过程\n分布式训练，并行策略执行、通信优化，每一轮训练（单步训练）流程包括：\n数据加载与预处理，可以是分布式数据加载，或动态批次构建。 前向传播（含激活重计算） 反向传播 梯度同步（数据并行） 参数更新（含梯度裁剪）\nTransformer结构的训练通常需要经过上万轮的训练，即上万个训练步数，训练时会充分利用GPU并行的特性，在分布式训练中并行，包括数据并行、模型并行、张量并行、流水线并行，且总GPU数 = 数据并行度 × 模型并行度。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult

\"Transformer的ffn对于所有token参数共享吗?-知乎\", chunk 0]\n============================================================\nRelevance Score: 0.448\nDocument Index: 57\nChunk Index: 0\nTitle: Transformer的ffn对于所有token参数共享吗?-知乎\n\n--- Content ---\n(Cite as: [long_context: \"Transformer的ffn对于所有token参数共享吗?-知乎\", chunk 0])\nTransformer的ffn对于所有token参数共享吗?-知乎\n\n结论先行：Transformer中的FFN（前馈神经网络）对所有token共享参数，这在标准实现中是一致的。它是1个nn.Linear（实际上是两个线性层组成的FFN），参数在所有8个token上共享，而不是为每个token使用8个不同的nn.Linear。\n Transformer模型中的FFN（前馈神经网络）通常对所有token共享参数。这意味着，无论序列中有多少token（例如8个），FFN都会使用相同的参数来处理每个token，而不是为每个token创建单独的网络。\n 在处理形状为(bs, 8, 768)的特征时，FFN由两个线性层组成，中间有一个激活函数（如ReLU）。这些线性层的参数在整个序列的所有位置上是共享的。在深度学习框架如PyTorch中，当你将张量输入到nn.Linear层时，它会自动对每个token应用相同的线性变换，因此参数是共享的。\n 参数共享的设计允许模型高效地处理变长序列，并且保持了模型的参数数量与序列长度无关。这也是Transformer能够并行处理序列的关键特性之一。\n FFN的参数共享方式与注意力机制类似，查询（queries）、键（keys）和值（values）在计算时也共享参数，这使得Transformer在处理长序列时保持了高效性。\n Transformer模型由Vaswani等人在2017年的论文“Attention is All You Need”中提出，其中FFN被描述为每个编码器和解码器层中的一个组成部分。论文明确指出，FFN是“position-wise”的，即对每个位置（token）单独且相同地应用。这意味着，FFN的线性变换参数在序列的所有位置上是共享的。\n 具体来说，FFN通常由以下形式定义：\n 公式为：[公式] ，其中 [公式] 和 [公式] 是权重矩阵， [公式] 和 [公式] 是偏置项。这些权重在整个序列上共享。\n 在实际实现中，例如在PyTorch或TensorFlow的Transformer模块中，FFN被实现为一个单一的神经网络模块，应用于输入张量的最后一个维度。例如，对于形状为(bs, 8, 768)的输入，nn.Linear(768, d_ff)会自动对每个token（即序列中的8个向量）应用相同的线性变换。这种设计确保了参数的共享性。\n 从计算效率的角度看，参数共享是必要的。如果为每个token使用不同的参数，模型的参数数量会随着序列长度线性增长，这在处理长序列时会变得不可行。例如，对于序列长度为1000的输入，如果不共享参数，参数数量会显著增加，训练和推理成本也会随之上升。\n 综上所述，FFN在Transformer中对所有token共享参数，这不仅符合理论设计，也在实际实现中得到了广泛应用。一个意想不到的细节是，FFN的参数共享方式与注意力机制的共享参数类似，这两者共同构成了Transformer高效处理序列的核心能力。\n\n\n============================================================\nCITATION

在大规模语言模型的训练过程中，性能瓶颈往往成为制约迭代效率和成本控制的核心问题。尽管硬件算力持续提升，但实际训练中仍频繁遭遇吞吐量低、收敛缓慢等问题。深入剖析其根源，有助于从系统架构与算法协同设计的角度优化整体训练效率。 \n显存带宽与计算资源的不匹配\n 现代GPU虽具备强大的浮点运算能力，但显存带宽的增长速度远落后于计算能力。这导致大量时间消耗在数据搬运而非实际计算上。例如，在处理千亿参数模型时，激活值和梯度的存储需求极易超出显存容量，引发频繁的CPU-GPU间数据交换。 \n高精度训练（如FP32）加剧显存压力 激活检查点机制虽缓解内存占用，但增加计算开销 张量并行策略若划分不当，会引入额外通信延迟\n分布式训练中的通信开销\n

使用环形约简（Ring All-Reduce）进行梯度聚合，各 GPU 按拓扑顺序分段通信，降低带宽压力。通信开销主要取决于模型参数量和网络带宽。 \n# 自动触发梯度同步\n 上述代码中， DDP  包装模型后，在  loss.backward()  完成后自动执行跨进程梯度同步，无需手动干预。 \n通信开销影响因素\n参数规模：参数越多，梯度张量越大，通信时间越长 GPU间连接：NCCL后端依赖高速互联（如InfiniBand）提升吞吐 批量大小：大batch增加梯度计算占比，相对降低通信占比\n2.2 多机多卡环境下梯度同步的性能调优\n 在分布式深度学习训练中，多机多卡环境下的梯度同步成为性能瓶颈的关键环节。合理优化通信机制可显著提升整体训练效率。 \n梯度同步策略对比\n 常见的同步方式包括同步SGD、Ring-AllReduce和Hierarchical AllReduce。其中Ring-AllReduce在大规模节点间表现出更优的扩展性。 \n 该函数遍历模型参数，对每个梯度执行全局规约并归一化，确保各节点梯度一致。dist.all_reduce采用环状通信，减少中心节点压力。 \n2.3 使用混合精度训练加速数据并行\n 在大规模模型训练中，混合精度训练结合数据并行可显著提升计算效率。通过使用FP16减少显存占用和带宽需求，同时保留FP32用于稳定梯度更新，实现速度与精度的平衡。 \n混合精度核心机制\n NVIDIA Apex等工具提供便捷的自动混合精度（AMP）支持。启用后，前向传播采用半精度，而关键计算如梯度缩放仍用单精度。 \n 上述代码中， autocast 自动管理张量精度类型， GradScaler 防止FP16梯度下溢，确保训练稳定性。\n\n\n============================================================\nResult 5\nCitation: [long_context: \"自监督学习：AI应用架构师如何用自监督学习提升模型性能？-CSDN博客\", chunk

年，Vaswani 等人在《Attention Is All You Need》中提出 Transformer 架构 ，彻底摒弃循环与 卷积 ，仅依赖注意力机制实现序列建模，成为 自然语言处理 领域的里程碑。\n两大显著优势：\n1.可捕获间隔较长的语义关联。\n2.充分利用分布式GPU进行并行训练，提升模型训练效率。\n二、Transformer 整体架构\nTransformer 总体架构包括四部分：输入、输出、编码器、解码器。\n（一）输入层\n1.词嵌入（Token Embedding）\n对输入的文本以单词为单位进行切分，再对单词序列编码，使用独热向量表达，再将独热向量映射为低维向量，可通过Word2Vec实现。\n2.位置编码（Positional Encoding）\n思路历程：整数位置编码→二进制位置编码→正弦位置编码\n为弥补注意力机制缺乏时序信息的缺陷，通过正弦 / 余弦函数生成位置向量，公式为：\n（二）、编码器（Encoder）\n由多个同样的编码器块组合而成\n1. 多头自注意力层（Multi-Head Self-Attention）\n注意力机制基本思想：“移动”量由 其他 词的意义(值)和其他词与当前词相关度决定。\n自注意力机制：\n（1）由每个编码器的输入向量生成三个向量，即查询向量、键向量和一个值向量。这三个向量是通过词嵌入与三个权重矩阵相乘后创建出来的。将以上所得到的查询向量、键向量、值向量组合起来就可以得到三个向量矩阵Query、Keys、Values。\n（2）计算得分。我们需要拿输入句子中的每个单词对目标单词进行打分。这些分数是通过所有输入句子的单词的键向量与“目标单词”的查询向量相点积来得到的。\n（3）将分数除以8(让梯度更稳定，这里也可以使用其它值),然后进行softmax处理。得到的softmax分数决定了每个单词对编码当下位置单词的贡献。\n（4）将每个值向量乘以对应softmax分数(以此来关注语义上相关的单词，并弱化不相关的单词),最后对加权值向量求和，即得到自注意力层在该位置的输出。\n多头自注意力机制：使用多组矩阵得到多组查询、键、值矩阵，然后每组分别计算得到一个Z矩阵，再得到最终的Z矩阵。这扩展了模型专注于不同位置的能力。\n2.前馈全连接层：Add（ 残差连接 ）、 Norm（层归一化）。\n（三）解码器（Decoder）\n解码器同样由N=6个层堆叠，每层包含三大子层：\n1. 掩码多头自注意力层\n掩码操作(mask)：计算注意力时，每一个新词(query)只能和之前出现的词进行相关运算。\n2. 多头自注意力层  与编码器相同\n3. 前馈 全连接层   与编码器相同\n（四）输出层\n由线性层和Softmax层串联而成。\n线性层：通过对上一步的线性变化得到指定维度的输出，也就是转换维度的作用.\nSoftmax层:使最后一维的向量中的数字缩放到0-1的概率值域内，并满足他们的和为1.\n\n\n==================================================\nSource 2\nCitation:

论文背景及意义\n在论文发表之前，循环神经网络（RNN）和长短时记忆网络（LSTM）是NLP领域的主要模型。然而，这些模型在并行计算和长序列处理上存在局限性。为了解决这些问题，\"attention is all you need\" 论文提出了一种全新的模型——Transformer。\n2. 论文主要观点与创新之处\nTransformer模型的核心思想是“注意力机制”，通过计算序列中各个元素之间的关联程度，来实现对输入序列的加权表示。其主要创新点如下：\n自注意力（Self-Attention）机制 ：通过计算序列内部元素之间的关联程度，实现对输入序列的全面理解。 多头注意力（Multi-Head Attention）

数据分片\n将大规模训练数据集划分为多个逻辑或物理片段（Shard）的技术，目的是实现高效的数据并行处理和分布式训练。\n数据分片的核心作用：\n解决内存与存储限制 ：单个节点无法加载全部数据，分片后每个节点仅处理部分数据。 并行加速训练 ：不同分片由不同计算设备并行处理（如GPU），缩短训练时间。 容错性 ：单个分片损坏或失败时，只需重新处理该分片，而非整个数据集。\n我们知道数据集是一张表，所以数据分片的方式方法和传统结构化数据分片类似，但这里要结合训练过程的实际情况做调整，数据分片常见方法：\n静态分片，预先规划好分片，每个GPU固定处理指定分片，优点实现简单，缺点是实际训练过程中可能导致GPU负载不平衡，因为数据集中的每一行长度是不同的，所以会导致数据倾斜。 动态分片，训练过程中动态分配数据（如通过中央调度器或分布式文件系统），优点：自动平衡负载，适应数据异构性。缺点：实现复杂，需额外协调开销（如Apache Spark或Ray框架）。 分片与数据管道的结合，流水线加载：当一个GPU处理当前分片时，异步预加载下一个分片（隐藏I/O延迟）；格式优化：分片常存储为高效二进制格式（如TFRecord、HDF5），加速读取。\n1.3.5 模型架构选择\n当前主流LLM通常是采用Transformer结构，包含自主力(Self-Attention)和多头注意力(Multi-Head Attention)的注意力层、前馈神经网络(FFN)，注意力层+FFN等模块组成一层，需要确定模型的层数和参数量。\n主流架构 ：Transformer（基于自注意力机制），常见变体：\nDecoder-only

：随机遮盖部分Token并预测（如BERT），遮盖比例通常15%。\n混合目标 ：如UniLM结合双向和单向预测。\n训练执行\n训练过程\n分布式训练，并行策略执行、通信优化，每一轮训练（单步训练）流程包括：\n数据加载与预处理，可以是分布式数据加载，或动态批次构建。 前向传播（含激活重计算） 反向传播 梯度同步（数据并行）

核心组件一：自注意力机制\n这是Transformer的灵魂。它允许模型在处理序列数据时，对每个位置的输入进行加权求和，得到一个全局的上下文表示。在计算自注意力时，模型首先将输入序列通过线性变换得到Q（查询）、K（键）和V（值）三个向量。然后计算Q和K的点积，并应用softmax函数，得到每个位置的权重。最后，将权重与V向量相乘，得到自注意力的输出。\n     核心组件二：多头注意力\n为了提高模型的表达能力，Transformer模型采用了多头自注意力机制。这意味着模型在同一时间关注来自不同表示子空间的注意力信息。多头自注意力的实现方法是通过多个独立的注意力头，每个头使用不同的权重矩阵对输入序列进行线性变换，生成各自的Q、K、V向量，并计算自注意力。最终，这些自注意力的输出被拼接起来，并通过一个线性层得到最终的输出表示。\n     核心组件三：前馈神经网络\n在计算自注意力和多头自注意力之后，Transformer模型使用前馈神经网络对输入序列进行变换。前馈神经网络由多个全连接层组成，每个全连接层都使用ReLU激活函数。前馈神经网络的作用是对输入序列进行非线性变换，以捕捉更复杂的特征。\n     核心组件四：位置编码\n位置编码是通过在输入序列的每个位置添加一个固定长度的向量来实现的。这个向量包含了该位置在序列中的信息，如位置标识符和相对位置等。\n     应用场景\n文本分类\n文本分类是Transformer模型最常见的应用之一。通过将文本输入到模型中，可以得到每个类别的预测概率分布。常见的文本分类任务包括情感分析、新闻分类、电影评论分类等。例如，BERT等经典模型在情感分析任务上取得了很好的效果，能够准确识别文本中的情感倾向。\n命名实体识别\n命名实体识别是自然语言处理中的一项重要任务，旨在识别文本中的特定实体（如人名、地名、组织名等）。\n\n\n==================================================\nSource

模型并行（Model Parallelism） ：\n张量并行（Tensor Parallelism） ：将单个矩阵运算拆分到多GPU（如Megatron-LM）。 流水线并行（Pipeline Parallelism） ：将模型层拆分到多GPU（如GPipe）。\n举例GPT-3的预训练情况，加深直观理解：\n参数量：1750亿 训练数据：约3000亿token 训练步数：约94000步（批量大小3.2M tokens/步，3000亿/3.2M 约等于94000） 耗时：数周（使用数千张A100 GPU） 上下文大小：原始上下文长度是2048 Tokens，硬件显存和注意力计算复杂度的权衡结果，Transformer的自注意力机制计算复杂度为 O(n2)（n为序列长度），导致显存和计算成本随序列长度急剧增长。\n这里批量大小和上下文大小的关系是：序列数=批次大小/上下文长度=3.2*10^6/2048≈1562 个序列/步，批次大小是并行训练的序列数量，而上下文长度是单个序列的长度。这里对tokenization后的数据集进行切分为一个个小块（chunk），这个chunk的大小就是上下文窗口长度（context window），chunk的大小是序列长度，批次大小是同时处理的chunk数量，训练批次总token数是两者的乘积。\n单轮训练结果\n在预训练的阶段，每一轮预训练训练的结果是得到一个基础模型（Base Model），这个模型可以预测每一个输入序列tokens的下一个token，可能每个词汇token都会有一个概率，这里是统计性和概率性的结果，是对训练数据集的回放。\n上图得到的next token ID 是19348(\" Direction\")，但是我们期望的是3962（\" Post\"）概率更高一些。所以，在完成一轮训练后，我们会用测试数据集进行测试，计算Lost函数，并将拟合偏离反馈到神经网络的参数调整上，这样下一轮训练后，token ID 3962（\"

在文章提到的三种方法中，如何有效地将它们组合使用？具体来说，如何设计损失函数来平衡不同学习目标，使它们能够互相促进而不是相互干扰？ 自监督学习可能会学习到一些表面的统计相关性而非真正有意义的特征。如何设计机制来区分和过滤这些\"伪相关\"特征？这个问题在多模态学习中尤其重要。 MiniGPT-4采用Adapter架构进行模态对齐，但这种方式可能会带来信息损失。如何评估这种损失，并设计更好的架构来降低信息损失？ 在多轮对话场景下，如何让自监督学习模型保持对话的连贯性和上下文理解能力？现有的掩码策略是否足以处理长程依赖关系？ 自监督学习在处理时序数据时，如何平衡短期和长期依赖的建模？特别是在视频理解任务中，如何设计时序掩码策略来捕获不同时间尺度的特征？\n训练好的视觉大模型

通过数据本身的结构和规律自动生成标签 这种性质源于数据本身包含的丰富信息和内在关联\n正反例对比：\n正例：BERT预训练中预测被遮挡的词，模型能够通过上下文学习语言的语义和语法特征 反例：完全随机遮挡和预测，没有利用数据的内在结构，模型无法学到有意义的特征\n类比理解：\n类比：自监督学习就像是\"自学成才\"的学生 解释：传统监督学习像是老师教学生（需要标注数据），而自监督学习像是学生自己看书学习（从数据本身学习），通过理解书本内容的逻辑关系来掌握知识\n概念介绍与总结：\n 自监督学习是一种机器学习范式，它不依赖外部标注，而是利用数据本身的结构来构建学习目标。通过设计巧妙的学习任务，让模型在完成这些任务的过程中学习到有用的特征表示。\n概念重组：\n

Transformer架构\n\nTransformer是当前LLM的基础架构，由Vaswani等人在2017年的论文《Attention Is All You Need》中提出。其核心组件包括：\n\n1. **自注意力机制（Self-Attention）**：\n   - 允许模型在处理序列数据时，对每个位置的输入进行加权求和，得到全局上下文表示\n   - 通过计算查询向量（Query）、键向量（Key）和值向量（Value）之间的关系来实现\n   - 公式：Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V\n\n2. **多头注意力（Multi-Head Attention）**：\n   - 将输入序列分割为多个头，每个头从不同子空间学习信息\n   - 扩展了模型专注于不同位置的能力\n   - 公式：MultiHead(Q, K, V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W^O\n\n3. **位置编码（Positional Encoding）**：\n   - 为弥补注意力机制缺乏时序信息的缺陷，通过正弦/余弦函数生成位置向量\n   - 使模型能够理解序列中元素的位置关系\n\n4. **前馈神经网络（Feed-Forward Network）**：\n   - 每个注意力层后接非线性变换\n   - 由两个线性层组成，中间有一个激活函数（如ReLU）\n\nTransformer的优势在于：\n- 可捕获间隔较长的语义关联\n- 充分利用分布式GPU进行并行训练，提升模型训练效率\n- 适用于多种NLP任务，具有较强的泛化能力\n\n### 2. 学习动态分析框架\n\n本论文提出的学习动态分析框架是理解LLM微调过程的关键工具：\n\n1. **基本公式**：\n   - Δlog πt(y|xo) = -η·At(xo)·Kt(xo, xu)·Gt(xu, yu) + O(η²)\n   - 其中，πt表示模型在t时刻的预测概率，η是学习率\n\n2. **三个关键组成部分**：\n   - At(xo)：与模型当前预测概率相关的矩阵，表示模型对不同输出的偏好\n   - Kt(xo, xu)：经验神经切向核，表示不同输入之间的\"相似度\"，决定了学习一个样例对另一个样例的影响强度\n   - Gt(xu, yu)：残差项，表示模型预测与目标之间的差距，决定了学习的方向和强度\n\n3. **应用于LLM微调**：\n   - 对于SFT：Gt_SFT = πθt(y|xu) - y+_u\n   - 对于DPO：Gt_DPO+ = β(1-a)(πθt(y|x+_u) - y+_u)，Gt_DPO- = β(1-a)(πθt(y|x-_u) - y-_u)\n   - 其中a是边际值，β是正则化系数\n\n### 3. 微调技术\n\n论文分析了两种主要的微调技术：\n\n1. **监督式微调（Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT）**：\n   - 使用高质量的指令-响应对训练模型\n   - 目标是最小化模型预测与目标响应之间的交叉熵损失\n   - 学习动态特点：对目标响应施加\"拉高\"压力，对其他响应施加\"压低\"压力\n\n2. **直接偏好优化（Direct Preference Optimization, DPO）**：\n   - 基于人类偏好数据，使模型学习区分好的响应和差的响应\n   - 不需要强化学习，直接优化模型参数\n   - 学习动态特点：同时包含正向和负向梯度，对选择响应施加\"拉高\"压力，对拒绝响应施加\"压低\"压力\n\n3. **挤压效应（Squeezing Effect）**：\n   - 当在概率分布的\"谷区\"施加大的负梯度时，会导致几乎所有维度的概率被压低\n   - 同时，概率质量会被\"挤压\"到原本概率最高的输出\n   - 这一效应在DPO等偏好优化方法中尤为明显，可能导致模型输出变得更加\"尖峰化\"\n\n## 四、视频补充要点\n\n视频讲解对论文内容进行了更直观的展示，补充了以下关键点：\n\n1. **学习动态的直观解释**：\n   - 通过MNIST数据集的例子，展示了当模型学习识别数字\"4\"时，如何影响对数字\"9\"的预测\n   - 这种影响取决于两个输入在特征空间中的相似度（通过Kt矩阵表示）\n\n2. **LLM微调中的幻觉现象**：\n   - 视频展示了当模型学习响应y+_j≠u（训练集中其他问题的响应）时，其对当前问题xu的预测概率会持续增加\n   - 这解释了为何模型可能会将问题A的回答用于问题B，导致特定类型的幻觉\n\n3. **挤压效应的可视化**：\n   - 视频通过概率分布图直观展示了挤压效应：当在低概率区域施加负梯度时，几乎所有维度的概率被压低，而概率质量被\"挤压\"到原本概率最高的输出\n   - 这解释了为何DPO训练的模型可能会生成重复短语或固定模式的输出\n\n4. **改进方法**：\n   - 视频提出了一种简单但有效的方法来改进对齐性能：在SFT阶段同时使用选择响应和拒绝响应进行训练\n   - 这种方法可以减轻后续DPO中的挤压效应，提高模型的对齐性能\n\n## 五、总结与启示\n\n本论文通过学习动态的视角，深入分析了LLM微调过程中的模型行为变化，揭示了SFT和DPO等微调方法的本质差异。研究发现，SFT主要通过\"拉高\"目标响应的概率来优化模型，而DPO则同时包含正向和负向梯度，可能导致\"挤压效应\"。这些发现不仅解释了微调过程中的多种现象，如幻觉产生和模型退化，还为改进微调方法提供了理论基础。\n\n对于初学者而言，本研究提供了理解LLM微调过程的新视角，强调了分析模型行为变化的重要性。通过学习动态分析，我们可以更好地理解模型为什么会产生特定的输出，以及如何设计更有效的微调策略来改进模型性能。\n\n未来研究可以进一步探索如何利用学习动态分析来设计更有效的微调方法，减轻挤压效应和幻觉问题，提高模型的对齐性能和生成质量。\n\n## 参考资料\n\n1.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT. After that, the “push-down” pressure imposed during DPO can\n\nu ] and [xu; y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\n9\n\n02468Number of epochs220200180160140Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. its rephrasesy+uy+gptsy+gptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesyuygptsygptf02468Number of epochs220200180160140120Rejected v.s. its rephrasesy+gptsygptsy+gptfygptf02468Number of epochs240220200180160140120Chosen v.s. rejectedy+uyu02468Number of epochs250200150100All other responsesWhere the probability mass gone?Argmax\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 5: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Since y−\n\nu is no longer so unlikely\n\nTable 1: Win-rate against baseline.\n\nWe call our training pipeline “extend” and compare its learning dynam-\nics with the baseline setting in Figure 5. It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y.

Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.) The extend method considerably increases y−\n\nwe impose twice “pull up” pressure, i.e., those for (x, y−\nu ), compared with the baseline. However, at the\nbeginning of DPO, we observe a clear drop in the orange curve. That is because the negative gradients are\nexactly imposed on those y−\nu ) is already very high). Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al. (2022) proved and further discussed in Appendix B. For multi-label\nclassification (L > 1), the updates separate; we can calculate L different ∆ log πt and stack them together.\nProposition 1. Let π = Softmax(z) and z = hθ(x). The one-step learning dynamics decompose as\nKt(xo, xu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V\n\n= −η At(xo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V\nwhere At(xo) = ∇z log πθt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nneural tangent kernel of the logit network z, and Gt(xu, yu) = ∇zL(xu, yu)|zt.\n\nθt(xo), Kt(xo, xu) = (∇θz(xo)|θt)(∇θz(xu)|θt)⊤ is the empirical\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\nGt(xu, yu)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:124)\nV ×1\n\n+ O(η2∥∇θz(xu)∥2\n\nop),\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 1: The per-step learning dynamics and the accumulated influence in an MNIST experiment.\n\nAt(xo) = I − 1π⊤\nθt(xo) only depends on the model’s current predicted probability. The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2.

We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu . That is\nbecause the upward pressure is directly imposed on y+\nu rather than these rephrases. Similarly, in the second\n\nDPO introduces a pair of arrows on both y+\n\ngpts, and y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu or y−\n\ngptf, y−\n\ngpts, y+\n\nu (y+\n\n8\n\n0123456Number of epochs180160140120100Averge log-probabilityChosen v.s. rejectedy+uyuy+gptsy+gptfy+testyhum0123456Number of epochs440430420410400390380370360Non-human responsey+urndy'rnd0123456Number of epochs180170160150140130Whether y occured during trainingy+juy+test024681012141618Number of epochs (<10 is SFT)600500400300200100SFT then DPO using similar hypersy+uyuy+gptsygptsy+urndyrndy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumyrndDPOy+uyuy+gptsygptsyhumy+juy+testyrndAccumulated influence14013012011010090y+u0.80.60.40.20.00.20.40.60.8\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 4: Learning dynamics of off-policy DPO.

That is because these responses are close to y+\nY, which means their ∥Kt∥F is relatively large. Hence the pressures imposed on y+\na non-negligible influence on them. Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

For the DPO and IPO loss,\nthe directions of the updating signals are identical.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y. Wu et al. 2024) propose another interesting self-play alignment algorithm called\nSPPO, which further improves the alignment performance on top of many on-policy DPO methods. Our\nframework could also give an interesting explanation of why this method works so well. Specifically, the loss\nfunction of SPPO can be written as:\n\nLSPPO = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:34)(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2\n\n(cid:18)\n\n+\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\nη\n2\n\n(cid:19)2(cid:35)\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nGt\nSPPO = 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n−\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y+\n\nu ) + 2\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n+\n\n(cid:19)\n\nη\n2\n\n(πθt − y−\n\nu ).\n\n(22)\n\nThis loss looks similar to the IPO one, but the main difference between SPPO and other methods (e.g., DPO,\nKTO, IPO, SPIN, etc.) is that there is no negative sign in front of πθt(y+\nu ). From its\nresidual term Gt\nSPPO, it is more convenient to understand this algorithm as imposing two positive vectors on\nboth y+\nu and y−\nu , but the former has a longer norm, as illustrated in Figure 2. By doing so, the big negative\ngradient no longer exists, and so does the squeezing effect. That is partly why this method is more stable and\nperforms better.\n\nu ) or πθt(y−\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nC THE “RELATIVE STABLE” ENTK ASSUMPTION\n\nWe use this appendix to verify the core assumption of our analysis – during the training, the relative influence\nof learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable – on both MNIST and LLM finetuning settings.

The 2-D plane of Y by considering the distance in both format and semantics.\n\nD.1 THE SELECTION OF RESPONSE TYPES FOR THE PROBING DATASET\n\nBesides the sequential nature of the loss function, another conundrum in analyzing LLM learning dynamics is\nthe huge response space Y: the number of possible y ∈ Y is V L, but the vast majority of possible sequences\nlook nothing like natural language, and we expect the model to generate only a subset of natural language-like\nresponses. These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly.

The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training. See Figure 16, where the solid curves and dotted curves represent the learning\ndynamics of responses in Dprob and Dprobtest respectively. The color of the curves represents the model\nwe are finetuning.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.)

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

To derive Equation (34), we need to have the analytical expression of each pt+1\ni. As p =\nSoftmax(z), we need to link zt+1 and zt first. With Equation (32) and (33), zt+1 can be recursively written\ndown as:\n\nand pt\n\ni\n\nzt+1 = (wt+1)⊤ϕ(x)\n\nϕ(x)\n\n= (cid:0)wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤(cid:1)⊤\n= (wt)⊤ϕ(x) − η (cid:0)ϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤(cid:1)⊤\n= zt − η∥ϕ(x)∥2\n= zt − η′(pt − ey)\n\n2(pt − ey)\n\nϕ(x)\n\n(36)\n\nwhere η′ ≜ η∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 is the equivalent learning rate that depends on the norm of feature representation. Note\nthat z, p and ey are all length-V vectors and y is an integer ranging from 1 to V . Then we can write down\neach zt+1\n\nas:\n\ni\n\nzt+1\ni =\n\n(cid:40)\n\ni + η′,\ni − η′pt\nzt\ni − η′pt\nzt\ni,\n\nif i = y\n\nif i ̸= y\n\n(37)\n\nThen, we can combine the definition of Softmax function and write down different pt+1\nCase 1 where i = y, we have:\n\ni\n\ncase-by-case.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35).

Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value.

Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1.

Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension. The\none for SFT is the same as Figure 5 in the main context. Key trends to observe: 1.) Baseline and the extend\nmethod have similar behavior on y+\nu during\nSFT; 3.) The squeezing effect of the extend method is weaker (all other responses decay slower and the\nconfidence on argmax response increases slower).\n\nu during SFT; 2.)

Furthermore,\nat the end of DPO, we see the “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is significantly lower than the\nbaseline setting, which implies that the squeezing effect is restrained in our setting.\n\nu (in the second panel of Figure 5, πθ0(y−\n\nIn order to figure out whether the model trained using the proposed flow, which successfully restrains the\nsqueezing effect, indeed does alignment better, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of these models’ responses\nand report their win rate as in (Rafailov et al. 2023). Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

In the second comparison, the model fine-tuned using DPO indeed aligns with human value better.\nThe win rate of the proposed method is slightly higher, which might also be explained as E1 leaving more\nspace for improvement. Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.

Sutherland\nUniversity of British Columbia & Amii\ndsuth@cs.ubc.ca\n\nABSTRACT\n\nLearning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influ-\nences the model’s predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding\nthe behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language\nmodels during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of\nhow influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a\nuniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algo-\nrithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypo-\nthetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning,\ne.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question\nA, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We\nalso extend our framework and highlight a unique “squeezing effect” to explain a previously\nobserved phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running\nDPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides\ninsights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analy-\nsis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM’s finetuning but also inspires\na simple, effective method to improve alignment performance. Code for experiments is\navailable at https://github.com/Joshua-Ren/Learning_dynamics_LLM.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nDeep neural networks usually acquire new knowledge by updating their parameters via gradient descent (GD).\nThis procedure can be described by learning dynamics, which links changes in the model’s predictions to the\ngradients generated by learning specific examples. With the help of learning dynamics, researchers have not\nonly explained many interesting phenomena during training, e.g., the “zig-zag” learning path (Ren et al. 2022)\nand the formation of compositional concept space (Park et al. 2024), but used these insights to propose novel,\nimproved algorithms in different problems (e.g. Pruthi et al. 2020; Ren, S. Guo, et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2024).\n\nThe study of large language models (LLM) is gaining popularity due to their surprising capabilities on various\ntasks. To ensure the LLMs follow human instructions and align well with human preferences, finetuning has\nattracted much recent attention. Practitioners often start with instruction tuning, where the model learns extra\nknowledge necessary for the downstream task, and then preference tuning, where the model aligns its outputs\nto human preference (Ouyang et al. 2022). Various finetuning algorithms have been proposed to fit into this\npipeline, with differing explanations as to why they improve the model’s performance.\n\nContrary to most existing analyses of LLM finetuning, which use the perspective of their training targets,\ntheir status at the end of training, or their relationships to reinforcement learning (e.g. Ji et al. 2024; Rafailov\net al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024), this paper tries to understand LLMs’ evolution from a dynamical perspective.\nSpecifically, we formalize the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning by decomposing the change of the\nmodel’s prediction into three terms which play different roles. This framework can be easily adapted to\n\n1\n\n5\n2\n0\n2\n\nn\nu\nJ\n\n9\n2\n\n]\n\nG\nL\n.\ns\nc\n[\n\n4\nv\n0\n9\n4\n0\n1\n.\n7\n0\n4\n2\n:\nv\ni\nX\nr\na\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nvarious finetuning algorithms with different goals, including supervised finetuning (SFT, Wei et al. 2022),\ndirect preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. (2023), and its variants) and even reinforcement learning\nbased methods (e.g., PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). This framework helps explain several interesting and\ncounter-intuitive observations during training – including the “repeater” phenomenon after preference tuning\n(Holtzman et al. 2020), hallucination (L. Huang et al. 2023), the decay in confidence of all responses during\noff-policy DPO (Rafailov et al. 2024), and more.\n\nMoreover, we also provide a new perspective on understanding why off-policy DPO and other variants\nunderperform their on-policy counterparts (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). Our explanation starts by\nobserving an interesting “squeezing effect,” which we demonstrate is a consequence of gradient ascent (as\nin DPO and similar algorithms) on models with cross-entropy loss following a softmax layer. In short,\nfor each token’s prediction, the negative gradient will push down the model’s predictions on (almost) all\npossible output labels, moving this probability mass to the most-likely labels. This can be detrimental to the\nalignment we are trying to achieve. This effect is most serious when the negative gradient is imposed on an\nalready-unlikely label, which is why the confidence of almost all responses decreases during off-policy DPO.\nInspired by this, we propose a simple but very effective method to further improve alignment performance.\n\n2 DEFINITION OF LEARNING DYNAMICS AND AN MNIST EXAMPLE\n\nLearning dynamics is usually an umbrella term describing how the change of a specific factor influences the\nmodel’s prediction. In this paper, we narrow down it to describe “how the change in model’s parameter θ\ninfluences the corresponding change in fθ”, i.e., the relationship between ∆θ and ∆fθ. When the model\nupdates its parameters using gradient descent (GD), we have\n\n∆θ ≜ θt+1 − θt = −η · ∇L (fθ(xu), yu) ; ∆f (xo) ≜ fθt+1(xo) − fθt(xo),\n(1)\nwhere the update of θ during step t → t + 1 is given by one gradient update on the sample pair (xu, yu) with\nlearning rate η. In short, the learning dynamics in this paper address the question:\n\nAfter an GD update on xu, how does the model’s prediction on xo change?\n\nLearning dynamics can shed light on many important problems in deep learning and also help to understand\nvarious counterintuitive phenomena. The origin of it might be the “stiffness” (Fort et al. 2019) or “local\nelasticity” (He and Su 2020; Deng et al. 2021) of neural networks. See Appendix A for more discussions.\n\nAs a warm-up, we first consider a standard supervised learning problem, where the model learns to map x\nto predictions y = {y1, . . . , yL} ∈ V L, where V is the vocabulary of size V . The model usually outputs a\nprobability distribution by first generating a matrix of logits z = hθ(x) ∈ RV ×L and then takes the Softmax\nof each column. We can track the change in the model’s confidence by observing log πθ(y | x).\n\nPer-step influence decomposition. The learning dynamics of (1) become,\n\n∆ log πt(y | xo) ≜ log πθt+1(y | xo) − log πθt(y | xo), .\n\n(2)\n\nFor simplicity, we start from the L = 1 scenario, where the ∆θ and ∆ log π can be linked by the following\nresult, a version of a result of Ren et al.

The matrix Kt is the\nempirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK, Jacot et al. 2018) of the model, the product of the model’s gradients\nwith respect to xo and xu. The analysis in this paper relies on the following assumption:\n\nDuring the training, the relative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable.\n\nThe common “lazy eNTK” assumption discussed in Arora et al. (2019) is a sufficient but not necessary\ncondition for this paper. Appendix C provides a more detailed discussion and experimental verification for\nboth MNIST and LLM settings. We can then think of Kt as a model-specific similarity measurement between\ndifferent input samples: larger ∥Kt∥F means the update of xu likely influences the model’s prediction on xo\nmore. Finally, Gt is determined by the loss function L, which provides the energy and direction for the model’s\nadaptation. For example, for cross-entropy loss LCE ≜ −y⊤\nCE = πθt(y | xu) − yu,\na length-V vector that points from the model’s current predictive distribution to the desired supervisory\ndistribution. For typical “hard” labels, yu is a one-hot vector eyu .\n\nu log π(y | xu), we have Gt\n\nAccumulated influence and a demonstration on MNIST. Proposition 1 describes how the update of xu\nchanges the model’s prediction on xo for each learning step. Since a real model updates its parameters for\nmany steps, it is important to ask about accumulation of these per-step influences over time. We start by\nanalyzing a simple example of training a LeNet on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al. 1998).\n\nSee Figure 1-(a), where the network πθt is updating its parameters using the loss calculated on one training\nexample (xu, yu = e4). The residual term Gt\nCE(xu, yu) is then represented by the red arrows, which all start\nfrom πθt(y | xu) and point to e4. We can then ask how the model’s predictions on different xo change after\nthis update. As in Figure 1-(b), for an xo in the same class with xu (i.e., the identical case), the predicted\nprobability of this correct label is “pulled up” by this update, as expected. On the other hand, if this xo is\nsimilar to xu (i.e., ∥Kt∥F is reasonably large) but comes from another class, then the predicted probability on\nxu’s class (not the correct label of xo) would be “pulled up,” as in the second panel of Figure 1-(b). Last, for\nexamples that look dissimilar to xu (small ∥Kt∥F ), this update will not change the model’s prediction on xo\nmuch, as in the bottom panel in Figure 1-(b). The interactions among the updates of different inputs then form\nan interesting pattern for the learned predictions. As illustrated in Figure 1-(c), when making predictions on\nimages coming from class 4, the model tends to assign higher confidence on class 9. That is because the\nexamples in class 9 on average look more similar to class 4 than examples in other classes. Hence the update\nof examples in classes 4 and 9 will reinforce their mutual influence and lead to a bump in their predictions.\nTo verify this, we plot the average of π(y | x) for x from each of the classes in Figure 1-(d). The values of\nsome off-diagonal patches are significantly higher than others, which means the examples in those classes\nlook more similar, like 4 and 9, 5 and 3, 8 and 5, etc.\n\n3\n\nLearn                                  using SGD(𝐱𝐮=,𝐲𝐮=4)(a) Adaptation vector created by (𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(b) One-step change with the same 𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)(large 𝜂)(c) Accumulated change of epochsΔlog𝜋𝑡(𝐱𝐨)=−𝜂𝒜𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝒦𝑡(𝐱𝐨,𝐱𝐮)𝒢𝑡(𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮)Strong influence,𝐲(,𝐲)(,𝐲)Weak influence𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮+𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐮−𝐱𝐮,𝐲𝐫𝐧𝐝′(d) Correlation of the accumulated change𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Identical:𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐨)𝜋𝜃𝑡+1(𝐱𝐨)𝐲=𝜋𝐱𝐨=Similar:𝐲=𝜋𝑥o=Dissimilar:0...4...9𝜋𝜃𝑡(𝐱𝐮)e𝑦=4Δ𝜋\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n3 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nAlthough learning dynamics have been applied to many deep learning systems, extending this framework to\nLLM finetuning is non-trivial. The first problem is the high dimensionality and the sequence nature of both the\ninput and output signals. The high-dimensional property makes it hard to observe the model’s output, and the\nsequential nature makes the distributions on different tokens mutually dependent, which is more complicated\nthan a standard multi-label classification problem considered by most previous work. Furthermore, as there\nare many different algorithms for LLM finetuning – SFT (Wei et al. 2022), RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022), DPO\n(Rafailov et al. 2023), etc. – analyzing them under a uniform framework is challenging. Finally, compared\nwith the training-from-scratch scenario, where a roughly uniform distribution over all possible outputs is\nusually assumed, LLMs’ finetuning dynamics heavily rely on the pretrained base model, which could make\nthe analysis harder. For example, the pretrained model usually assigns little probability mass to unlikely\ntokens, which is good for most applications but leads to risk of the “squeezing effect” we show later. We now\ntackle these problems and propose a unified framework for different finetuning methods.\n\n3.1 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE SFT LOSS\n\nThe typical loss function used during supervised finetuning is the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of a given\ncompletion y+\n\nu = [y+\n\n1 , . . . , y+\n\nLSFT(xu, y+\n\nu ) ≜ −\n\nL ] ∈ V L, conditioned on the prompt xu:\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nlog π(y = y+\nl\n\n| y+\n\n<l, xu) = −\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\ney+\n\nl\n\n· log π(y | xu, y+\n\n<l).\n\n(4)\n\nNote that compared with the multi-label classification problem discussed before, where the joint distribution\nof all labels can be factorized as π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x), the sequential nature of language modeling\nmakes the analysis more complicated, because we must have π(y | x) = (cid:81)\nl π(yl | x, y<l). To solve this\nproblem, we can merge this factorization into the definition of the backbone hθ while keeping the format of\nProposition 1. Specifically, letting χ be the concatenation of x and y, the prediction of all tokens of y is\n\nz = hθ (χ) ;\n\nπ (y | χ) = Softmax_column (z) .\n\nHere z is a V ×L matrix where each column contains the logits of the prediction of the lth token. Our hθ, even\nthough it takes the entire sequence χ as its input, will force the model not to refer to the future tokens y>l when\nmaking predictions on the l-th token, commonly implemented via “causal masking” (proposed in Vaswani\net al. (2017), details in Figure 10a of Appendix D). Then, we can calculate (∇θzl(χo)|θt)(∇θzl(χu)|θt)⊤ on\neach column of z and stack them to form a V × V × M × L tensor Kt(χo, χu). The calculation of Gt and\nAt follows a similar procedure. Thanks to the causal mask implemented in hθ, the resulting decomposition\nis almost identical to that in a multi-label classification problem. Assuming have a response yu of length L\nassociated with xu, stacked into χu, and yo of length M associated with xo, stacked into χo. The change of\nthe model’s prediction on the m-th token of yo can be represented as, when z gradients have bounded norm,\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:124)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Gt\nterm also depends on the responses yu and yo, which allows us to answer questions like\n\nSFT (χu) = πθt(y | χu) − yu. Compared with Proposition 1, the main difference is that the eNTK\n\nFor a prompt xu, how does learning the response y+\n\nu influence the model’s belief about a response y′\n\nu?\n\nWhen tracking the model’s confidence on different responses given the question xu, learning from y+\nimpose a strong “upwards” pressure on y+\n\nu will\nu , as illustrated in the first panel of Figure 2. At the same time,\n\n4\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthe confidence of “similar responses” will also be slightly pulled up, like how learning a 4 influences the\nprediction on 9 in the MNIST example. We will discuss how to understand the “similarity” between two\nsequences of responses in the next section.\n\n3.2 PER-STEP DECOMPOSITION OF THE DPO LOSS\n\nPreference finetuning, which teaches the model to provide responses that align better with human preferences,\nis also an important phase in LLM finetuning pipelines. Different from the SFT stage above, where the\ntraining tells the model “what to do”, many preference finetuning methods also teach the model “what not\nto do,” which makes the learning dynamics more complex. For intuition, we start by analyzing a typical\nmethod, i.e., DPO (direct preference optimization, an RL-free method), under a similar framework. Following\nRafailov et al. (2023), the loss function of off-policy DPO is\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nu and y−\n\nu are pre-generated responses, and πref is the reference model, typically the result of SFT. χ+\nu\nu share the same x but different y. In the loss function, the πθt terms are also calculated using teacher\n\nwhere y+\nand χ−\nforcing. Hence we can decompose the learning dynamics for DPO similarly to Equation (5),\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)]m = −\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[At(χo)]m\n\n(cid:0)[Kt(χo, χ+\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO+]l − [Kt(χo, χ−\n\nu )]m,l[Gt\n\nDPO-]l\n\n(cid:1) + O(η2)\n\nDPO+ = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ+\nGt\n\nu ) − y+\nu\n\n(cid:1) ;\n\nDPO- = β(1 − a) (cid:0)πθt(y | χ−\nGt\n\nu ) − y−\nu\n\n(cid:1) ,\n\n(7)\n\nu and y−\n\nDPO+/-. In other words, Gt\n\nwhere a is the margin (i.e., the σ(·) value) for the l-th token, which represents how well the current policy\nseparates y+\nu compared with the reference policy. Due to the monotonicity of σ(·), a larger margin\nleads to larger a, which in turn restrains the strength of Gt\nDPO+/- automatically provides\nless energy on the examples that are already well separated. We then check the role of β, which controls the\nregularizing effect on the KL distance between πθt and πref in the original RL loss (Rafailov et al. 2023).\nWhen the margin is negative, larger β leads to a smaller a and hence provides stronger Gt\nDPO+/- for the model\nto “catch up” the separating ability of the reference model faster. But when the model is better and has a\npositive margin, increasing β will increase a and hence create a negative influence on β(1 − a), which makes\nthe model update less. This aligns well with the claims of Rafailov et al. (2023): the stronger regularizing\neffect tends to “drag πθ back towards πref” when its predictions deviate from πref too much. The derivation\nand the Gt functions for other RL-free methods are given in Appendix B.2.2.\nThese analyses make no assumptions on where y+\nu and y−\nu come from. Hence our framework can be directly\nextended to on-policy RL-free methods, which often perform better than their off-policy counterparts (S.\nGuo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024; Tajwar et al. 2024). The main difference between these algorithms is how the\nsupervisory responses are generated. Off-policy methods typically use a fixed pre-collected dataset, with y+\nu\nand y−\nu are generated by another LLM or humans. In other words, it is likely that both the chosen and rejected\nresponses come from the “less likely” region of the model’s prediction. On-policy responses, though, are more\nlikely to have higher predicted probabilities under this model, as they were sampled from it. We will show\nnext that imposing large negative pressure on an unlikely prediction will lead to unexpected behavior, giving\na new explanation for why on-policy sampling is important for algorithms with large negative gradients.\n\n3.3 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT CAUSED BY NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nAs demonstrated by the first two panels in Figure 2, the use of large negative gradients is the main difference\nbetween the learning dynamics of SFT and DPO. We will show later that this difference is the key to\nunderstanding why the learning curves of SFT and DPO behave so differently. For example, Pal et al. (2024),\n\n5\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 2: The updating vector provided by the residual term Gt of different algorithms. The gray y are\nresponses sampled from π in an on-policy way. In the second panel, we demonstrate the “squeezing effect”\ncaused by imposing a big negative gradient on a “valley” region of a distribution. For more details about this\ncounter-intuitive effect, please refer to Section 3.3 and Appendix E. Other panels demonstrate on-policy DPO\n(and IPO), SPIN (Z. Chen et al. 2024), SPPO (Y. Wu et al. 2024), and SLiC (Y. Zhao et al. 2023).\n\nRafailov et al. (2024), and Tajwar et al. (2024) (and our Figure 4) reported that the confidence of both y+\nu and\ny−\nu gradually decreases when conducting DPO, while the confidence of y+\nu rarely drops during SFT. This\ntrend becomes more serious if πθ0 is finetuned for longer before conducting DPO (reported in Figure 3 of\nRafailov et al. (2024) and verified by our Figure 17). Furthermore, we also find that for all the πθt(y | χu)\nwe track (various responses similar to y+\nu ; details in the next section), none of them increase during the\nDPO phase. This is different from SFT and quite counter-intuitive:\n\nu or y−\n\nIf everything we observe is becoming less confident, where has the probability mass gone?\n\nTo answer this question, we first identify a phenomenon we call the squeezing effect, which occurs when using\nnegative gradients from any model outputting a distribution with Softmax output heads, even in a simple\nmulti-class logistic regression task. Specifically, in the L = 1 case when we impose a negative gradient on\nlabel y−\n\nu , we can describe the changing of model’s predictive distribution πθt+1 as follows:\n\n• Guarantee: the confidence of y−\n• Guarantee: the decreased probability mass is largely “squeezed” into the output which was most\nu } πθt(y = i), then πθt+1 (y = y∗) will increase.\n• Trend: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer: generally, dimensions with high πθt tend to increase,\n\nconfident before the update: if y∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y−\n\nu , i.e., πθt+1(y−\n\nu ) will decrease.\n\nand those with low πθt tend to decrease.\n\n• Trend: peakier πθt squeezes more. If the probability mass concentrates on few dimensions in πθt, which\n\nis common for a pretrained model, all πθt+1(y ̸= y∗) decrease (only y∗ is “rich”).\nu ) exacerbate the squeezing effect: if y−\n\n• Trend: smaller πθt(y−\n\nu is unlikely under πθt, the probability mass\n\nof all other πθt+1 (y ̸= y∗) will be more seriously decreased, and the πθt+1(y = y∗) increases more.\n\nAppendix E illustrates the squeezing effect and analytically proves its existence for logistic regression models,\nby directly computing πθt+1/πθt in different situations. Section 4.2 also experimentally verifies the analysis\nabove in real LLM experiments. Note that in practical settings, where both positive and negative pressures\nand the auto-regressive nature are strictly considered, the squeezing effect can become more complicated.\nThe differences between the two eNTK terms in Equation (7) also influence the relative strength and direction\nof these two pressures. Razin et al. (2025) analyze a similar problem in a token-level setting, and their\nconclusions align with ours well. We left a more detailed analysis to our future work.\n\nu and y−\n\nWe can now get a high-level overview of the learning dynamics of a typical off-policy DPO algorithm. Since\nboth y+\nu , and the\ny−\nu are likely located in a valley region of the model’s prediction. Then its learning dynamics would look like\nthe sketch in the second panel of Figure 2: the confidence on almost all y are pushed down. At the same time,\n\nu are not sampled from the model’s distribution, y∗ sometimes can be dissimilar to y+\n\n6\n\n•On-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPIN𝐲u+𝐲u−•SPPO𝐲u+𝐲u−•SLiC𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲refTriggered whengap is smaller than 𝜹•SFT•Off-policy DPO, IPO𝐲u+𝝅𝜽𝟎(𝐲|𝐱𝐮)𝝅𝜽𝒕Caused by squeezing effect𝐲u−𝐲u+𝐲∗\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nall the decreased probability mass is squeezed to y∗, which might make the model keep generating repeated\nphrases, as reported by Holtzman et al. (2020). Variants of DPO algorithms often unintentionally mitigate this\nsqueezing effect by constraining the strength of the negative gradient or the positions of y−\nu , which partially\nexplains their benefits. The last four panels in Figure 2 and Appendix B.2.2 have more details.\n\n4 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe now verify our analysis in practical settings. We first create the training set Dtrain by randomly selecting\n5000 examples from the training split of the dataset. We consider two common datasets, Antropic-HH\n(Y. Bai et al. 2022) and UltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), in all experiments. Each example in Dtrain\ncontains three components: the prompt (or question) x, the preferred response y+, and the less preferred\nresponse y−. SFT finetunes with x and y+, while DPO uses all three (subscripts of x and y are removed\nfor conciseness). We repeat the experiments on two series of models: pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B\n(Biderman et al. 2023) and Qwen1.5-0.5B/1.8B (J. Bai et al. 2023).\n\nTo get a more detailed observation of the learning dynamics, we further create a probing dataset Dprob\nby randomly selecting 500 examples from Dtrain, and generate several typical responses based on the\ncorresponding x, y+, or y−. (We also study another probing dataset where all x come from the test set in\nan ablation study in the appendix.) Then for each x in Dprob, we can observe how log πθt(y | χ) gradually\nchanges on different types of y. For example, one extended response type can be a rephrase of y+, an\nirrelevant response answering another question x′, or just a randomly generated English sentence with the\nsame number of words with y+. We explain why we need these extended responses and how they are\ngenerated in detail in Appendix D.1. In short, Dprob helps us to get a more fine-grained inspection of the\nlearning dynamics, which can not only support our analysis above, but also shed more light on how the\nmodel’s prediction evolves on the entire Y ∈ RV ×L, a very sparse and huge space.\n\n4.1 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF SFT\n\nu |χu) naturally “pushes down” all y ̸= y+\n\nThe main lesson we learn from the analysis in Section 3.1 is that learning from y+\nu not only increases the\nu , but also indirectly “pulls up” responses similar to y+\nmodel’s confidence on y+\nu with a smaller strength\n(scaled roughly by ∥Kt∥F ), similar to how learning a “4” influences the prediction of a “9” in the MNIST\nexample. At the same time, the increase of πθt(y+\nu , because the\nmodel’s predicted probability to all responses in Y-space must sum to one. The model’s behavior on different\ny is mostly a trade-off among these pressures. To verify this claim, we finetune the model for several epochs\nand evaluate the model’s prediction on all responses in Dprob every 25 updates (with a training batch size of 4,\nthe probing occurs every 100 examples). For each type of response, we average the model’s confidence on all\n500 examples and report the mean value of their log-likelihood.\nAs demonstrated in the first panel of Figure 3, the model’s confidence on y+\nu keeps increasing throughout the\nwhole learning process, which is straightforward because the main “pull-up” pressure is imposed directly on\ny+\nu . However, the behavior of some responses similar to y+\nu is non-trivial. For example, we draw the following\ntypes of responses in the same panel, i.e., the less preferred response for the same question (y−\nu ), two types\nof rephrases of y+\ngptf), another preferred response randomly selected\nfrom the test set (y+\ntest), or even a randomly generated English sentence (yhum). The model’s confidence in\nthese responses are all slightly increased at the beginning of training, and then gradually decrease as the\ntraining goes on, even though the model never sees them during SFT. This counter-intuitive behavior can\nbe well explained by the learning dynamics we discussed before. Since all these examples are “similar” to\ny+\nu to some extent (at least, they are all common “standard English” sentences), their ∥Kt∥F are reasonably\nlarge. Then learning y+\nu will indirectly increase the model’s confidence of these similar y. That is why the\ncorresponding πθt(y|χu) are slightly increased at the beginning of training. However, as the training goes\n\nu generated by ChatGPT (y+\n\ngpts and y+\n\n7\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 3: First three: learning dynamics of SFT on different response types. Fourth: SFT 10 epochs then\nDPO. Last: the accumulated influence when SFT using different y (full results in Appendix C and D).\n\non, the model’s confidence on y+\nSFT in Equation (5),\ngradually decreases. That means the indirect “pull-up” pressures are also diminished accordingly. Then, the\n“push-down” pressure on all y ̸= y+\n\nu keeps increasing and the update energy, the norm of Gt\n\nu becomes dominant and all the related curves start going down.\n\nu . One is a purely random English word sequence y′\nu , which is called y+\n\nTo verify the existence of this global “push-down” pressure, we observe two types of responses; both have the\nsame number of words as their y+\nrnd. Another is a random\npermutation of all the words in y+\nurnd. Since both are not natural language, we expect the\n∥Kt∥F between them and y+\nu to be very small, which means learning from y+\nu imposes almost no “pull-up”\npressure on them; thus the “push-down” pressure will dominate through the whole training procedure. These\nanalyses are well supported by the second panel in Figure 3, in which we see these πθt(y|χu) all start from a\nvery small value, and keep decreasing throughout the training.\nAnother interesting type of responses is y+\nj̸=u, a preferred response for another question xj̸=u in the training\nset. For these responses, the model’s prediction on πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) will be kept influenced by two “pull-up”\npressures: one is from learning [xu; y+\nj̸=u], where the latter might be even\nstronger as the gradient is directly calculated by observing y+\nj̸=u. That explains why we see the confidence\non y+\nu in the third panel. Because the “pull-up”\npressure is always strong enough to counter the “push-down” one. These observations provide us with a\nunique explanation of why specific types of hallucinations are amplified after SFT. Specifically, the increase\nof πθt(y+\nj̸=u|χu) means if we ask the model to answer a question xu, it might provide a response from (or\npartially from) another unrelated question xj̸=u in the training set.\n\nj̸=u keeps increasing with a smaller rate compared with y+\n\nu ], another is from learning [xj̸=u; y+\n\nLast, to further explore the “similarity” between different responses from the model’s perspective. we SFT\nthe model using more types of responses and observe how πθ(y′ | χu) changes accordingly. The results are\ndemonstrated in Figure 3, where the blue and orange colors represent the positive and negative influence\nrespectively. The x-axis is the updating response while the y-axis denotes the observing response. Hence the\nfirst column resembles how different [xu; y′] changes when we SFT the model using [xu; y+\nu ]. One interesting\nfinding is that all responses generated by ChatGPT are considered very similar to each other, regardless\nof how semantically different they are. Probably, LLM has its preferred idioms or phrases, which could be\nconsidered as a type of “fingerprint”. We left this interesting problem for our future work.\n\n4.2 LEARNING DYNAMICS OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nTo verify our framework also explains the model’s behavior in preference tuning, we conduct similar\nexperiments for DPO. Recall the residual term Gt\nu , with\ndifferent directions. To show how these two pressures influence the model, we check two types of rephrases\nof y+\ngptf, used in the previous experiment). See the three curves in the first\npanel in Figure 4, where the two rephrases decrease at a similar speed, faster than the decay of y+\nu .

Last, in the fourth panel, the margin πθt(y+\nincreasing, which means the model is gaining the ability to separate y+\nu as the training goes on.\nAlthough Gt\nDPO directly imposes a “pull-up” pressure on y+\nu |χu) does not increase a lot\nas it does in SFT. The downward arrow on y−\nu indeed introduces a “push-down” pressure on responses that\nare similar to y−\nu , but the influence is unlikely to be that strong (it will be weakened by ∥Kt∥F ) to make the\nconfidence on almost every observing responses decrease so fast, as demonstrated in the last panel of Figure 3\nwhere we use similar η for both SFT and DPO. Then, where has the probability mass gone during DPO? The\nkey to answering this question is the squeezing effect discussed in Section 3.3: since the big negative gradient\nis imposed on y−\nu , which is at this point probably in a region of low πθt(y|χu), the confidence of most y will\nbe decreased and πθt(y∗|χu) will increase very fast.\nTo verify this, we report the log-likelihood of y chosen by greedy decoding: each token is chosen by\nmaximizing the conditional probability given [xu; y+\nu . As\nillustrated by the last panel of Figure 4, the confidence of this “teacher forcing” greedy y increases very fast\n(from -113 to -63), which is even faster than the increase of πθt(y+\nu |χu) during SFT (from -130 to -90), within\n8 epochs. However, the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it\nwill reinforce the prior bias in θ0. This could be a reasonable explanation of the “degeneration” reported in\nrecent work (e.g. Holtzman et al. 2020): as πθt becomes more peaky at its most confident predictions, it is\neasier to sample sequences with repeated phrases. Note that such behavior could also be understood as a\nspecial type of self-bias amplifying (Ren et al. 2024), which would bring more serious consequences if it is\ncombined with a multiple-generation self-improving algorithm, e.g., self-reward (Yuan et al. 2024), iterative\nDPO (Xiong et al. 2024), etc.\n\n<l] in real-time, where y+\n\n<l is a sub-sequence of y+\n\nIn summary, the behaviors of different types of responses all match our analyses well. More subtle trends of\ndifferent responses support our story well (both for SFT and DPO).Due to space constraints, we explain these\n(and the full results on other models and datasets) in Appendix D.\n\n4.3 MITIGATING THE SQUEEZING EFFECT BY AUGMENTING THE TRAINING SET FOR SFT\n\nSince the “squeezing effect” caused by the big negative gradient on unlikely predictions can damage the\nmodel’s performance during DPO, we can first train the model on both [xu; y+\nu ] during the SFT\nstage (making the negative response more likely), and then run the usual DPO. Following the analysis above,\nwe can expect during this new SFT stage, the region of those responses similar to y+\nu will be “pulled up”\nsimultaneously. This is what we want because in many cases, both y+\nu are reasonably good responses\nfor the question xu; the new SFT design hence helps to pull up a larger region that contains more suitable\nresponses compared with the baseline SFT.

It is clear that the squeezing\neffect is mitigated, because the confidence of other responses all decays\nslower during DPO, and we also observe a big drop in the greedy-\ndecoding response when DPO starts. To further show that mitigating\nthe squeezing effect indeed brings benefits, we compare the responses\ngenerated by models trained using different methods by feeding them\nto ChatGPT and Claude3. Specifically, we first SFT the model for\ntwo epochs using two methods discussed above and call the resulting\npolicy network πbase and πextend. Then, we conduct identical DPO\ntraining on both πbase and πextend for several epochs. The win rate of the proposed method against the baseline\none is provided in Table 1. It is clear that before DPO, πbase is better, because πextend is explicitly trained\non those y−. However, the πextend performs better after DPO several epochs since the squeezing effect is\nefficiently mitigated. Please refer to Appendix F for more details. In the future, this simple method inspired\nby our analysis could be further improved by introducing more responses, e.g., rephrases of y+\nu , etc., during\nboth stages, and also by combining with many existing RL-free methods we mentioned before.\n\nDPO Ep.

To better utilize this tool in\nthe context of LLM finetuning, we first derive the step-wise decomposition of LLM finetuning for various\ncommon algorithms. Then, we propose a unified framework for understanding LLM predictions’ behaviors\nacross different finetuning methods. The proposed analysis successfully explains various phenomena during\nLLM’s instruction tuning and preference tuning, some of them are quite counter-intuitive. We also shed\nlight on how specific hallucinations are introduced in the SFT stage, as previously observed (Gekhman et al.\n2024), and where the improvements of some new RL-free algorithms come from compared with the vanilla\noff-policy DPO. The analysis of the squeezing effect also has the potential to be applied to other deep learning\nsystems which apply big negative gradients to already-unlikely outcomes. Finally, inspired by this analysis,\nwe propose a simple (but counter-intuitive) method that is effective in improving the alignment of models.\n\n10\n\n0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050Log probabilityChosen y+ubaselineextend0246810Number of epochs30025020015010050yu is the peak nowRejected yu0246810Number of epochs500400300200100All rephrasesNon-human sequenceOther responses0246810Number of epochs1301201101009080Drop at the start of DPOArgmax response\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was enabled in part by support provided by the Canada CIFAR AI Chairs program, WestGrid,\nand Compute Canada.

For example, if we consider xu from the training set, and xo from the test set, this form of\nlearning dynamics provides a new perspective on generalization: the model generalizes better if the loss of\nfθ(xo) keeps decreasing when it learns from xu. By studying the influence of different xu at different stages\nduring supervised learning, Ren et al. (2022) explain a “zigzag” pattern of the learning path, which sheds\nlight on why the model can spontaneously pursue better supervisory signals and correct noisy labels in the\nearly stage of training (see also S. Liu et al. 2020). Kumar et al. (2022) and Ren, S. Guo, et al. (2023) apply\nlearning dynamics to explain why directly finetuning a well-trained backbone with a randomly initialized task\nhead might harm the out-of-distribution generalization ability. Ren et al. (2020), Ren, Lavoie, et al. (2023),\nand Ren and Sutherland (2024) also explains where the simplicity bias favoring compositional representations\ncomes from during knowledge distillation (Hinton et al. 2015), providing a new perspective of understanding\nwhy successive knowledge transferring can improve the model’s systematic generalization ability.\n\nThe network’s local elasticity (He and Su 2020) and stiffness (Fort et al. 2019) are also correlated with this\ntopic. It reveals that neural networks operate like adaptive local learners, influencing only nearby points in\nfeature space during training. This gives them a unique edge over linear models in terms of memorization,\nstability, and the emergence of meaningful internal structure—all without explicit regularization. The authors\nof Deng et al. (2021) further link this behavior to the model’s generalization ability. Extending their theoretical\nframework to more complicated settings like LLMs’ finetuning might be a promising direction.\n\nBesides explaining the model’s behavior, learning dynamics is also helpful for evaluating the quality or the\neffectiveness of different training samples. For example, Pruthi et al. (2020) propose a quantitative metric\ncalled TracIn to compute the influence of a training example on the predictions made by the model. This\nmetric is then applied by Xia et al. (2024) to search for the most influential examples in LLM instruction\nfinetuning. By expanding Equation (1) in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, S. Guo, Ren, et al. (2024)\npropose a metric called lpNTK to measure the relative difficulty among different training samples. These\nmetrics and analyses inspired by learning dynamics are expected to be helpful in many related fields, like\ncoreset selection (Feldman 2020), active learning (Settles 2009) (see, e.g., Mohamadi et al. 2022), and dataset\ndistillation (T. Wang et al. 2018).\n\nA.2 MORE ABOUT LLM’S FINETUNING\n\nIn this paper, we broadly define finetuning as any in-weight learning on top of a pretrained base model,\nincluding supervised finetuning (SFT), direct policy optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al. 2023) and its variants,\netc. Since the analysis throughout this paper relies on the “teacher forcing” mechanism and the relatively stable\neNTK assumption, our framework cannot be directly applied to algorithms with token-wise supervision like\nreinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF, Ouyang et al. 2022) and proximal policy optimization\n(PPO, Schulman et al. 2017). We leave the study of the token-wise learning dynamics, which aligns better\nwith the “squeezing effect” in real settings, to future work.\n\nWe also identify several related works that report similar observations on the phenomena discussed in this\npaper. For example, Gekhman et al. (2024) and Yue Zhang et al. (2023) mentioned that learning new facts\nduring SFT tends to make the model hallucinate more, which aligns with our finding that the model tends to\nuse y+\nj̸=i when answering question i. Holtzman et al. (2020) related the peakiness of the model’s distribution\nto LLM’s “repeater phenomena”, which also indirectly supports our claims well: more DPO leads to a more\nserious squeezing effect, hence the model’s prediction becomes peakier on most tokens, which makes the\naforementioned phenomena more common.\n\n15\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFurthermore, the “confidence decaying on y+\nu ” attracts more attention in the community, because it is quite\ncounter-intuitive and the vanilla off-policy DPO algorithm works reasonably well in most cases. Many related\nworks study this phenomenon by analyzing the major discrepancy between off-policy DPO and PPO, i.e.,\nwhere the samples used to train the model comes from, e.g., S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. (2024), Rafailov et al.\n(2024), and Tang et al. (2024). They showed that when the responses are off-policy sampled, the learning\nprocess may fail to benefit from the contrastive information in the data. In other words, we should be more\ncareful when working on the “valley” region of the model’s distribution. Other works try to analyze this\nproblem by inspecting the token-level influence between responses. For example, Pal et al. (2024) assumes\ny+\nu are identical expect one token. Under this assumption, the model’s confidence of y+\nu and y−\nu after the\nidentical token is guaranteed to decrease. They propose a solution by significantly enhancing the learning rate\n(roughly x50 larger when their λ = 50) of the positive part when detecting yu located in a low-confidence\nregion. Razin et al. (2025) takes the similarity between the hidden embeddings and the geometry of the\nreadout layer of different responses into account. Most of the conclusions of their paper align with ours well.\nThe main discrepancy lies in the squeezing effect part, which we will discuss in our future work (they do not\ncontradict each other, but need a more detailed analysis to understand the whole story).\n\nA.3 BENIGN AND HARMFUL NEGATIVE GRADIENT\n\nThe “squeezing effect” can negatively impact our analysis when it is strongly imposed in a valley region\nof the model. However, a well-regulated negative gradient is both beneficial and commonly observed in\nmany deep-learning systems. For example, it is common in many “machine unlearning” algorithms, e.g., in\nR. Zhang et al. (2024). Moreover, even in the field of LLM finetuning, we can find many mechanisms in\ndifferent popular algorithms that can mitigate this effect. For example, the typical learning rate of DPO is\nusually smaller than that used in SFT, which unintentionally mitigates the harmful squeezing effect. The\non-policy counterpart of the DPO-like algorithms is shown to perform better than their off-policy counterparts,\nwhich also supports our claims. Furthermore, we find the PPO loss automatically avoids imposing a big\nnegative gradient (when its ˆAt is negative) on the valley region (when its πθ is small).\nOn the other hand, the effect that negative gradients make the model’s distribution peakier is independently\nreported in many related works. For example, Equation 1 in Caccia et al. (2020) shows that we are minimizing\na negative thing in a standard GAN loss, which might explain why peakiness occurs. Furthermore, in\nTable 1 and Table 2 of Choshen et al. (2020), we see the peakiness (measured by ∆ptop10, ∆pmode) of the\n“PG-average” method is stronger than the standard PG method. Note that the “PG-average” method will\nmap a reward ranging from 0 to 1 to a centered one ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. Since the negative reward can\nintroduce a negative gradient, the peakiness increases.\n\nB PROOF OF PROPOSITIONS AND RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LOSSES\n\nB.1 PROOF OF PROPOSITION 1\n\nProposition 1.

Intuitively,\nif their gradients have similar directions, the Frobenius norm of this matrix is large, and vice versa. This\nmatrix is known as the empirical neural tangent kernel, and it can change through the course of training as\nthe network’s notion of “similarity” evolves. For appropriately initialized very wide networks trained with\nvery small learning rates, Kt remains almost constant during the course of training, the kernel it converges to\nis known as the neural tangent kernel (Arora et al. 2019; Jacot et al. 2018). Note that the assumption that\nKt(xo, xu) is unchanged (usually used in theoretical analysis) might be too strong in the LLM’s finetuning.\nHence as stated in the main context, our qualitative analysis only assumes that “during the training, the\nrelative influence of learning xu on all other different xo is relatively stable”. We will validate this assumption\nusing experiments in Appendix C.\n\n1Note that this proposition assumes L = 1. For L > 1 case, we will have multiple task heads which leads to L\n\ndifferent Equation (3). The V × L matrix ∆ log πt can then be achieved by stacking them.\n\n17\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nB.2 RESIDUAL TERM FOR DIFFERENT LLM FINETUNING ALGORITHMS\n\nAs stated in Section 3, one of the conundrums of decomposing the learning dynamics of LLM is its auto-\nregression nature of the output sequence. Different from the multi-label classification problem, where yl for\ndifferent l is independently generated as long as the shared network is fixed, the yl for the LLM’s output\ndepends on y<l, which is usually sampled from the model’s prediction iteratively. However, in most of\nthe finetuning cases where the supervisory signal yu is given, the model will apply the so-called “teacher\nforcing” mechanism when calculating the predicting probabilities. In other words, when generating the\noutput of each yl, the y<l is given rather than sampled on-policy. This mechanism makes it possible for us\nto define χ = [x; y] and hence merge the auto-regressive nature of the sequence prediction into the shared\nKt(χo, χu). After this step, the decomposition of LLM’s finetuning learning dynamics then becomes similar\nto a multi-label classification task.\n\nB.2.1\n\nINSTRUCTION FINETUNING USING AUTO-REGRESSION LOSS (SFT)\n\nHere we derive the residual term, i.e., Gt for different algorithms in LLM’s finetuning. We first rewrite\nEquation (5) here:\n\n[∆ log πt(y | χo)\n]m = −\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×M\n\nL\n(cid:88)\n\nl=1\n\nη[ At(χo)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×V ×M\n\n]m[Kt(χo, χu)\n(cid:125)\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\n(cid:124)\nV ×V ×M ×L\n\n]m,l[Gt(χu)\n(cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125)\nV ×L\n\n]l + O(η2),\n\nwhere m ∈ {1, . . . , M }, l ∈ {1, . . . , L}, and Gt(χu) = ∇zL(χu)|zt is a V × L matrix. As the auto-\nregression nature of the SFT loss is already encoded in the causal mask used in hθ, as demonstrated in\nFigure 10a. the columns in Gt(χu) are independent of each other, which can be separately calculated. Plus,\nthe summation over l can also be achieved by left-multiplying a length-L all-one vector 1. Specifically, the\nSFT loss for each l is:\n\n[LSFT(χu)]l = − log π(yl = y+\n\nu | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog π(yl | χu) = −e⊤\ny+\nu\n\nlog (Softmax(zl)) ,\n\nwhere y+\n\nu is for the l-th dimension of y+\n\nu .

(2023)) is usually considered the first RL-free alignment\nalgorithm for preference finetuning. Different from the standard RLHF (reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (Christiano et al. 2017)), the training of off-policy DPO is more similar to SFT, where the model\nkeeps learning from a pre-generated preference dataset. Hence, we start from DPO to analyze the learning\ndynamics of different preference finetuning algorithms (the on-policy versions of these algorithms could also\nbe explained using the proposed framework).\n\nFollowing Rafailov et al. 2023, the training loss of DPO is:\n\nLDPO(θ) = −E\n\n(xu,y+\n\nu ,y−\n\nu )∼D\n\n(cid:20)\n\n(cid:18)\n\nlog σ\n\nβ log\n\nπθt(y+\nπref(y+\n\nu | χ+\nu )\nu | χ+\nu )\n\n− β log\n\nπθt(y−\nπref(y−\n\nu | χ−\nu )\nu | χ−\nu )\n\n(cid:19)(cid:21)\n\n.\n\n(12)\n\nBefore calculating the residual term Gt\ntion, because the loss term now depends on both πθt(y+\ntwo different z terms.

The SLiC loss can be considered as a combination of SFT adaptation and preference adaptation.\nSimilarly, we can also see a hard version of the regularization effect mentioned above. If Gap(πθt) > δ, the\nindicator function will become zero, and the model stops pushing π(y+\nu ) away when it already\nseparates y+\n\nu ) and π(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu well.\n\nRecently, authors of (Y.

These properties prevent us from observing the changes of all possible y like what we did for\nMNIST. Instead, we define several interesting regions of Y, and select corresponding typical responses to\nobserve. Intuitively, we can use the semantic relevance between y and xu as a heuristic. Such a measurement\ncan be understood as “how suitable this y is as a response to xu, compared to y+\nu .” Then, starting from\nthe structure of common preference optimization datasets such as Antropic-HH (Y. Bai et al. 2022) and\nUltraFeedback (G. Cui et al. 2023), we can divide Y into three sub-spaces and evaluate the following\n\n25\n\n01020304050230240250260270280290Auo2FAverage Peakiness Change during SFTy+uyinity+gptsy+gptfyuygptsygptfy+juy+testyhumy+urndyrnd0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during SFTargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)0102030405010080604020Average of log(y*) and log(yc) during DPOargmaxexcept_argmaxlinear fit of log(pc)𝒙𝒖LLMPredictionsSupervisionCE-Loss𝒚𝒖+𝒚𝒖+𝝌𝒖≜(𝒙𝒖,𝒚𝒖+)Causal mask with prefixModelCE-Loss 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝒍−𝟏) 𝑙𝜋(𝒚𝒍|𝒙,𝒚𝟏:𝑳;𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐤)What do you mean by cheating?Could you clarify whatyou mean by cheating?It’s interesting, this isn’t a topic that I’ve studied extensively, so I’ll be happy to just think about it together.

By comparing the learning curves of these two probing datasets, we\ncan figure out the difference between the model’s prediction of those directly influenced responses (y appears\nduring training) and the indirectly influenced ones (y that the model never sees during training). Finally,\nwe believe the level of the “on-policy” property (which is very important for the preference finetuning, as\ndiscussed in Tajwar et al. (2024)) could also be introduced as the second axis in our 2-D plane. We left the\nexploration of this interesting direction in our future work.\n\nD.2 MORE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT SETTINGS: SFT CASE\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. In this subsection, we provide more results to support\nour analysis on SFT in Section 4.1. The first thing to verify is the consistency of the trends of learning\ndynamics across different settings. As illustrated in Figure 14, we conduct SFT on five models with\ndifferent sizes pretrained using different recipes. Note that Pythia-410M/1B/1.4B/2.8B are pretrained\nusing exactly the same dataset and pipeline (Biderman et al. 2023), while Qwen1.5-0.5B are pretrained\ndifferently. Hence we can observe a slight difference between the curves from Pythia series and Qwen\nseries, e.g., those in yhum. However, the trends demonstrated in Figure 3 consistently hold for all models.\nCompare the rephrases of y+\nu . See Figure 15, where we put the rephrases of the same response\ninto the same figure. We can treat the red curve, i.e., the one of y generated by π0(x), as a baseline, whose\ndecaying suggests the policy model is deviating from the initial point. The first observation is that after\nseveral updates, y+\nu is the only one that keeps increasing fast, which means the “pull up” pressure generated\nby [xu; y+\nj̸=u], even though these y\n\nu ] do not have that strong influence on these rephrases compared to [xu; y+\n\nu and y−\n\n26\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 11: The prompts used to generate y+\nsimilarly. The self-rephrase template comes from Yang et al. (2024).\n\ngpts, and y+\n\nselfr, y+\n\ngptf. The rephrases of rejected samples are generated\n\nFigure 12: Example of all possible responses for one x in our probing dataset. Note that the pure random\ntoken is generated by first creating a random sentence, then randomly permuting its tokens.\n\nu (recall the curve y+\n\nare good rephrases of y+\nj̸=n always increase in Figure 14). Furthermore, by carefully\ncomparing the decreasing speed of yπ0 and other curves, we find those rephrases decays slower than yπ0 in\nthe chosen case, but not the case for the rejected responses. This phenomenon also supports our analysis well:\nbecause we train the model using y+\nu . Such\na claim is also verified by the experiment in the last column of this figure, where we train the model using\n[xu; y−\nu is now identical\nto that of yπ0 while the decaying speed of rephrases for y−\nu is slightly slower. Last, compare the green\nand orange curves (i.e., the format-keeping and semantics-keeping GPT rephrases), we find the predicting\nprobabilities of those format-keeping curves are usually larger than their semantic-keeping counterparts.\nThis is a sign that the model during SFT might care more about the format rather than the semantics of one\nsentence. We will delve into this interesting phenomenon in our future work.\n\nu . In these two panels, we see the decaying speed of rephrases of y+\n\nu , their rephrases are “pulled up” more than the rephrases of y−\n\nu ] rather than y+\n\n27\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes a task along with a reference answer.

To isolate the influence of the “pull up” pressure introduced by the training\nupdates, we also create another probing dataset Dprobtest using the same pipeline as Dprob. The only difference\nbetween them is that all x in Dprobtest comes from the test set, and hence neither the prompts nor the responses\never occur during training.

Note that as the responses of on-policy DPO change generation-by-generation, it is hard to observe\nthe dynamics of a pre-collected probing dataset. We left the exploration of how to effectively probe other\nDPO variants in our future work.\n\nConsistent learning dynamics for different models. Compare Figure 4 in the main context and Figure 18,\nwhere we provide the results on many different models (Pythia-410M/1B/2.8B and Qwen1.5-0.5B).\nTheir trends on different πθt(y) are quite consistent:\n\n1.) in the first column, the margin πθt(y+\n\nu ) − πθt(y−\n\nu ) keeps increasing. The πθt(y+\n\nu ) first increase and\n\nthen decrease, always with a smaller decay speed than that of πθt(y−\n\nu );\n\n2.) in the second column, πθt(y+\n\nu ) decreases slower than the other rephrases, verifying the “pull up”\n\npressure and the influence on other responses via Kt;\n\n3.) in the third column, πθt (y−\n\nu ) decreases faster than the other rephrases, verifying the “push down”\n\npressure and the influence on other y;\n4.) in the fourth column, the rephrases of y+\n\nu , supporting the claims that\nthe rephrases near the chosen responses are influenced by the “pull up” pressure while the rephrases\nof the rejected ones are influenced by the “push down” pressure.\n\nu decay slower than those of y−\n\nLearning dynamics of conducting SFT first, then DPO. As stated in (Ouyang et al. 2022), conducting\nSFT before DPO is a common pipeline for alignment. Using [xu; y+\nu ] as the SFT dataset is also a common\npractice in many existing works. Hence in this part, we plot the curves of different πθt(y) in both two stages\nto demonstrate their differences. See Figure 17, where the difference between the experiments in these three\nrows is how long the model is trained using SFT before DPO. The learning rate of both SFT and DPO are\ncontrolled to be the same (i.e., 5 × 10−7, the default value in (Tajwar et al. 2024)). All the curves are aligned\nby the 10th epoch on the x-axis (i.e., the starting time for the DPO training) for the convenience of comparing\nthe trends across different settings.\n\nWe first check the curves of SFT and DPO parts separately and find that all the above relative trends still\nhold in these experiments. We then compare the model’s behavior in these two phases respectively. In the\nlast two rows of Figure 17, where the epoch for SFT is non-zero, it is clear that the decaying speed of most\nobserving πθt(y) is much larger in DPO than those in SFT. The main reason for this is the existence of a\nbig negative gradient introduced in DPO. This gradient, especially conducted on a “valley” region of the\nmodel’s prediction, will “push down” the whole curve significantly, except the one with the highest confidence\nbefore updating. This non-trivial trend is named “squeezing effect”, which is elaborated on in Appendix E.\nFurthermore, a more peaky πθ0 (y) and a smaller πθ0 (y−\nu ) will lead to a stronger “squeezing effect”, which\ncan be verified by comparing the curves of the last two panels: longer SFT makes the model’s prediction\npeakier when DPO is conducted, which leads to a larger decay on all πθt(y) during DPO.\n\n31\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 17: The learning dynamics of conducting DPO after SFT the model for several epochs. We align\nthe starting point of DPO (i.e., the 10th epoch from the x-axis) to better compare the curves. Key trend\nto observe: 1.) Confidence of all responses decays way faster when DPO starts, which is caused by the\nsqueezing effect introduced via a big negative gradient; 2.) The more epochs we SFT the model, the more\nserious the squeezing effect is (confidence decays faster).

These two opposite pressures ensure the margin reward πθ(y+\nu | χ−\nu | χ+\nu )\nkeep increasing, which makes the model align better with human preferences. However, if we go deeper\nand consider πθ(y+\nu ) separately (actually we should, because their χu are usually\ndifferent), a very interesting phenomenon occurs. See the first column of Figure 18, we find although DPO\nalso contains a strong positive adaptation vector, the curve of πθ(y+\nu ) all goes down after several updates,\nwhich is very different from πθ(y+\nu ) in the SFT case. Such an observation is also reported in many\nrelated works (Pal et al. 2024; Rafailov et al. 2024; Razin et al. 2025; Tajwar et al. 2024), but a clear-cut\nexplanation of it is still missing. Furthermore, although the relative behaviors of various rephrases matches\nour analysis of learning dynamics well, merely the two pressures on y+\nu cannot explain why all these\nobserved πθ(y) keeps decreasing during training. So, it is natural to ask:\n\nu ) − πθ(y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu | χ+\n\nu | χ−\n\nu | χ+\n\nWhere has the probability mass gone?\n\nE.1 THE SQUEEZING EFFECT AND WHY IT EXISTS\n\nTo answer the above question, we can start from the properties of the basic Softmax function by analyzing a\nsimple multi-class logistic regression problem. Because no matter how complex the LLM is, its predictions\nare made by converting the logits into probabilities using Softmax heads. Note that the analysis here only\nconsiders the negative gradient, i.e., the one imposed by y−\nu in LLM’s finetuning. As also pointed by Razin\net al. (2025), the pull up pressure imposed by y+\nu when their χu\nare identical. However, when χ+\nu are dissimilar, the squeezing effect discussed in this paper still\ndominates. We left analyzing this intricate interaction between these two pressures is left to our future work.\n\nu will cancel the influence imposed by y−\n\nu and χ−\n\nConsider a simple V -class logistic regression problem where each high-dimensional input data x is converted\nto a length-d feature vector via a deep neural network ϕ. In other words, we have ϕ(x) ∈ Rd×1. The model\nuses a linear read-out layer w ∈ Rd×V to convert the feature vector to logits z = w⊤ϕ(x) and then generate\nthe probability prediction vector p using a Softmax head. We consider a common cross-entropy loss function\nfor each input pair (x, y). In summary, we have:\n\nLCE(pt, y) = −e⊤\n\ny log pt;\n\npt = Softmax(zt);\n\nzt = (wt)⊤ϕ(x),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere t is the index of the step during training and ey is a length-V one-hot vector determined by the ground\ntruth label y. To simplify our analysis, we assume a fixed ϕ and only update the parameters of the read-out\nlayer w using stochastic gradient descent:\n\nwt+1 = wt − η∇wL = wt − ηϕ(x)(pt − ey)⊤,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere η is the learning rate which can be negative if we consider a negative gradient during training. With\nEquation (32) and (33), we can write down each dimension of pt and pt+1 after some calculations. To\nquantitatively analyze how the model’s confidence in each class changes, we define a ratio αi ≜ pt+1\nand use\ni\npt\ni\nthe following lemma to describe its behavior:\n\nLemma 1.

Specifically, if αi > 1, the corresponding\npi increases, and vice versa. To determine the value of αi, we can treat any βj > 1 as contributing to the\nconclusion that αi < 1 while any βj < 1 against it. The value of the corresponding ezt\nj and |βj − 1| controls\nhow strong the contribution is. With the preparations above, we derive the following observations on how the\nconfidence evolves when a gradient ascent (i.e., η < 0) is imposed on class y.\n\n34\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 1: The value of py is guaranteed to decrease, i.e., αy < 1. We start from the value of β in Case\n1 as illustrated in Equation (35). It is clear that for any j ̸= y, we have βj > 1, because 1 + pt\ni > 0.\nCombining with βy = 1, it is straightforward to have Claim 1.\n\nj − pt\n\nClaim 2: The value of pi∗ where i∗ = argmaxi∈[V ]\\{y} pt\nnow use the value of β in Case 2, since i∗ cannot equal y by definition. When j ̸= y, we have pt\nfor all possible j, because pt\nCombining with the fact that βy < 1 (because pt\n\ni is guaranteed to increase, i.e., αi∗ > 1. We\ni∗ ≤ 0\ni̸=y of pt. Hence all βj̸=y must be smaller than one.\n\ni∗ − 1 must be negative), we can prove that αi∗ > 1.\n\ni∗ is the largest among all pt\n\ny − pt\n\nj − pt\n\nThe two claims above demonstrate that the parameter update can be imagined as taking the probability mass\nfrom py and redistributing that to other dimensions. From Claim 2, we know some of the mass is guaranteed\nto be “squeezed” into the dimension with the highest pt\ni∗ is the second\nhighest in pt). But how other pi changes is still not clear yet. Will the probability mass from py is also split\ninto other pi (i.e., other pi increases)? Or will pi∗ absorb the mass not only from py but also from other\ndimensions (i.e., other pi decreases)? To get a clearer picture, we need to track the adaptations of each pi. To\nachieve this, we now must scrutinize the distribution of pt, because it controls the value of ezt\nj for different j.\nWe chose three typical scenarios where pt is strictly uniform, slightly non-uniform, and extremely peaky, and\nleads to the following claims.\n\ny is the highest value, then pt\n\ni∗ (if pt\n\nClaim 3A: When pt is a uniform distribution, the probability mass decreased from class y is uniformly\ndistributed to all other i ̸= y, i.e., all pt+1\ni̸=y increase the same value. With the uniform pt assumption,\nEquation (34) can be simplified to αi =\n. Note that the first two claims hold for any distribution\n(cid:80)V\npt, hence we only check the values of αi̸=y here to verify the “uniformly distributed mass” hypothesis.\n< 1,\nSubstituting the values of βj to this new α leads to αi =\nwe must have αi̸=y > 1. Combined with the fact that all pt\n\nV −1+eη′ for all i ̸= y. Since η′ < 0 and eη′\ni are the same, this claim can be proved.\n\nV\nj=1 βj\n\nV\n\nClaim 3B: When pt is slightly non-uniform, pi with smaller pt\ni tend to decrease, and vice versa. This\nclaim is a general trend and might not have any guarantees. However, analyzing such a scenario helps us to\nunderstand the influence of pt better. Assume we are observing αi′ where i′ is not y nor i∗. We consider two\nsubsets of [V ] \\ {y}, i.e., B, which contains all j with pt\nj. Now\nconsider Case 2 in Equation (35), we have:\n\nj and S that contains all j with pt\n\ni′ ≤ pt\n\ni′ > pt\n\nβj=y ≪ βj∈S < 1;\n\nβj∈B > 1.\n\n(40)\n\nNote that we misuse the ≪ notation to highlight the fact that βj=y would be much smaller than βj∈S , because\nthere is a negative one term in the exponential. With the above expression, we can imagine that if pt\ni′ is\nrelatively small, the size of B would be large, which means there will be more βj > 1 contributing to the\nconclusion that αi′ < 1. If the influence of βj∈B is strong enough to override the influence of other β\n(especially βj=y which is way smaller than other β), αi′ would be smaller than one and hence pi′ decreases.\nOn the contrary, for those i′ with relatively large pt\ni′, the β < 1 terms becomes dominant and hence lead to\nαi′ > 1, i.e., pi′ increases.\nIn the analysis above, we assume pt is only slightly non-uniform (i.e., not so peaky), which means the\nvalues of different ezt\nj are relatively comparable. However, in practical machine learning systems like LLM’s\nfinetuning, the distribution pt would be very non-uniform, which means most of the probability mass is\nobtained by a few dimensions. That is because the LLM’s vocabulary size is usually very large and the\nreasonable choice of the next word is only a small portion of the whole vocabulary. Thus we have the\nfollowing claim to describe this practical scenario.\n\n35\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nClaim 3C: When pt is very peaky, which means most of the probability mass is obtained by i∗, then\nall other pi will decrease. In other words, the probability mass of all other pi is squeezed to pi∗ . We\ncontinue the analysis in Claim 3B but consider a more extreme influence on ezt\nj . For this peaky pt, we might\ni∗ that dominates α. In other words, αi ≈ ezt\nhave an very large ezt\ni∗\n= 1\nβi∗ . Then for any i′ we want to\nβi∗ ·ezt\ni∗\nobserve, the αi′ ≈ 1\nβi∗ < 1. In other words, the model’s predictions on all dimensions other than the one\nwith the highest confidence in pt will decrease.\n\nLast, we analyze the influence of py to explain why “imposing a large negative gradient on the valley region”\nmakes the squeezing effect more serious.\n\nClaim 4: Smaller pt\ny makes those non-max pi easier to decay, i.e., a stronger squeezing effect. This is\nalso a general trend that is observed in the experiments in Figure 20. Intuitively, since the model is already\nconfident that y cannot be the correct label (i.e., py is very small), letting the model further decrease the\nprediction on py does not make sense. We can also use the analysis above to understand how it happens. As\nillustrated in Equation (40), where the value of β is decomposed into three subgroups. Recall the definition of\nαi, we know all βj < 1 contribute to the hypothesis that pi increases after this update, where the strength\nof this contribution is controlled by ezt\nj , the influence of βj=y ≪ 1 is\nsignificantly weakened under this scenario. In other words, αi < 1 is more likely to occur for all possible i,\nwhich means the squeezing effect (all pj̸=y decreases) becomes more serious.\n\ny small means a small ezt\n\nj . Since a pt\n\nClaim 5: The learning rate with a larger absolute value |η| and a larger feature norm ∥ϕ(x)∥2\n2 will\namplify all the trends, maybe more serious than our expectation. Throughout our analysis, the equivalent\nlearning rate η′ < 0 is a shared scalar in all βj. Hence larger |η′| can amplify all the trends aforementioned.\nFurthermore, recall the shape of an exponential function ex, where a small change of x (especially when x > 1)\nwill make ex changes a lot. Then the terms βj̸=y = e−η′(1+pt\ni) in Case 1 and βj=y = e−η′(pt\ni−1) in\nCase 2 will play a stronger role if we use a larger learning rate |η| or the norm of features is larger.\n\nj −pt\n\nj −pt\n\nE.2 VERIFY THE SQUEEZING EFFECT USING A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT\n\nFigure 19: Illustration of how big positive and negative gradients influence the model’s prediction.\n\nLet us analyze a simple example to get an intuition. We set V = 50, d = 5, |η| = 0.5, and a randomly\ngenerated ϕ(x). In the first row of Figure 20, we consider the model updates its parameters using standard\nSGD assuming the label of this x is 21. Specifically, we randomly generate w0 by sampling each parameter\nfrom a standard Gaussian distribution and calculate w1 using Equation (33). The two curves in each panel\ndemonstrate the model’s predicted distribution before and after this update. As we expected, the positive\nvector on the 21st class “pull up” p0(y = 21) and “push down” all other p1(y) at the same time. This trend is\nquite consistent under different settings (i.e., different choices of V, d, x, η, w0, etc.), which can be depicted\nby the first panel in Figure 19.\n\n36\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nFigure 20: Experimental verification of the “squeezing effect” illustrated in Figure 19 using a simple multi-\nclass logistic regression task.\n\nWe then set η = −0.5 to simulate the negative gradient in DPO and consider three different settings. First,\nwe assume the model’s prediction on x is relatively flat, as demonstrated in the second row of Figure 20,\nwhere the predicting probability of every class is around 0.02. The negative gradient is imposed on y = 42,\na randomly selected number. We see the negative adaptation vector “push down” p1(y = 42) heavily and\nre-assign those decreased probability mass evenly to all other classes, as illustrated in the second panel in\nFigure 19.\nAlthough the behavior described above follows our intuitions well, a flat p0 is not common in LLM’s\nfinetuning. Because finetuning usually starts from a pre-trained w, where the model’s prediction would likely\nbe non-uniform. So in the third row of Figure 20, we consider a more practical w0 that leads to a multi-mode\np0. In this example, the model has relatively high confidence in classes 5 to 11 and low confidence in all\nother dimensions. We set the target label as 11 (i.e., the one in the model has the highest confidence) and\nuse η = −0.5 to “push down” the model’s prediction on this class. As demonstrated by the blue curve,\n\n37\n\n010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0A: Positive gradienty+uProbability change1001020304050107106105104103102101100y+uProbability change in log scale010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0B: Negative gradient flatyu01020304050103102yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0C: NG peaky on peakyu01020304050108106104102100yu010203040500.00.20.40.60.81.0D: NG peaky on valleyyu01020304050109107105103101yu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary0.00.20.40.60.81.0Large Vyu02004006008001000Index of vocabulary103810331028102310181013108103yu\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\np1(y = 11) decreases a lot as we expected. However, different from the flat p0 case, where the model evenly\nassigns the reduced probability mass to all other y, the model in this example “squeezes” the mass to those\nconfident predictions, i.e., classes 6, 9, and 10, leaving the confidence of other classes almost unchanged.\nSuch a trend is consistent when the negative gradient is imposed on the “peaky” region of a non-uniform\ndistribution, as illustrated in the third panel in Figure 19.\nThe previous setting simulates the on-policy DPO well, where the rejected examples y−\nu are sampled from\nthe high confidence region of the model’s predictions. Then, what will happen if we conduct off-policy\nDPO and impose a big negative gradient on those classes that already have very low confidence? See the\nfourth row of Figure 20, where we use the same w0 and η as in the previous case. The only difference is\nthat we change the label of x to 42, where p0(y = 42) is very small (roughly 10−5) before training. The\nbehavior in this setting is quite interesting: we first observe a big increase on p1(y = 11), which means the\nmodel “squeezes” the probability mass to the most confident one in p0, similar to the previous setting. More\ninteresting, the predictions on all other y are heavily “pushed down”, even including classes 6, 9, and 10,\nwhose confidence is relatively high before training. In the last two panels of Figure 20, we set V = 1000 and\nfind this trend is more obvious (that might be because the absolute value of the efficient learning rate, which\ndepends on ∥ϕ(x)∥, becomes larger). Since the vocabulary size of a common LLM is usually more than 50k,\nthe squeezing effect in real systems would be non-negligible even if the learning rate is small. Such a trend\nis also quite consistent as long as we impose a big negative gradient on the “valley” region of the model’s\nprediction, as illustrated in the last panel in Figure 19. Now we can answer the question of why all observing\nπθt(y) decreases and where the probability mass has gone:\n\nFor each token, the probability mass is squeezed to the one with the highest confidence.\n\nNote that the tokens with the highest confidence do not necessarily form a preferred response: it just reinforces\nthe prior knowledge contained in θ0, which could be a drawback for off-policy DPO.\n\nThe hypothesis above is not only supported by this simple logistic regression problem but also by many\nconsistent trends in LLM’s finetuning experiments. First, by comparing the average decaying speed of the\nπθt(y) when the model SFT different epochs before DPO (in Figure 17), we notice that longer SFT leads to a\nmore peaky πθ0(y) and hence leads to a faster decaying speed of all non-argmax responses. That is because\nthe longer SFT stage will eventually push down πθ0(y−\nu ) more. Hence in the DPO stage, the big negative\ngradient is imposed on a deeper valley region, which makes the squeezing effect stronger. Second, to directly\nverify this hypothesis, we track the sum of the log-likelihood of the tokens with the largest confidence and call\nit “argmax confidence”, i.e., (cid:80)\nyl | x, y1:l−1). As illustrated in the last panel in Figure 4,\nthe argmax confidence keeps increasing while all other πθt(y) decreases: the missing probability mass is\nfound! Last, in the dataset-extension method we proposed in Section 4.3 and Appendix F, we train the model\nusing both [x, y+\nu region before conducting DPO. Then, we\nobserve compared with the standard training flow, i.e., SFT using [x; y+\nu ] first and then DPO, the proposed\nflow has a lower “argmax confidence” during DPO. That is because we pulled up πθ0(y−\nu ) during the modified\nSFT stage, the big negative gradient is then imposed on the peaky region rather than the valley region of the\nmodel’s prediction. Such a change in turn weakens the squeezing effect, as illustrated in Figure 5.\n\nu ] during SFT to also “pull up” the y−\n\nl πθt(argmaxyl∈Yl\n\nu ] and [x, y−\n\nF A SIMPLE METHOD TO IMPROVE ALIGNMENT\n\nF.1 PINPOINTING THE DRAWBACK OF OFF-POLICY DPO\n\nBased on our observations and analysis above, we speculate that “imposing big negative gradients on the\nvalley region” is one of the bottlenecks of off-policy RL-free methods. Starting from this hypothesis, we\nbelieve introducing on-policy sampling has the potential to mitigate this problem, as demonstrated in SPIN\n(Z. Chen et al. 2024) and other online algorithms (S. Guo, B. Zhang, et al. 2024). However, we also speculate\n\n38\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\nthat these methods improve the model’s performance not only by mitigating the squeezing effect. Hence\nto figure out to what extent the squeezing effect can harm the model’s performance, we propose a simple\nyet effective method to isolate its influence. As this method can directly mitigate this effect, it can also be\nconsidered as an ablation study of this interesting phenomenon.\n\nFigure 21: Illustration of the proposed method and baseline. “E” is short for the “dataset extension”.\n\nF.2 A SIMPLE METHOD INSPIRED BY LEARNING DYNAMICS\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 21, where the baseline method is a standard SFT-then-DPO pipeline. The proposed\nmethod is very simple. We only need to augment the dataset used in SFT by adding (x, y−\nu ) pairs for each\nsample into it. All other settings are unchanged. The motivation for this method is also quite simple: as SFT\ncan pull up the region of supervised ˆy and we don’t want the model to impose big negative gradients on a\nvalley region, we can just pull up those y−\nu before DPO. Furthermore, as demonstrated in the third panel in\nFigure 19 and Equation (15), the negative gradient in DPO would be strong enough to push down πθt(y−\nu ),\nbecause the gradient will be large if the model cannot separate y+\nu well. In other words, under DPO’s\nloss, there is no need to worry about the model overfitting those y−\n\nu and y−\n\nu during SFT.\n\nF.3 EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION\n\nTo verify our analysis, we conduct experiments by finetuning a pretrained Qwen1.5-1.8B (J. Bai et al.\n2023) model using Antropic-HH dataset (Y. Bai et al. 2022) (we use a subset containing 5000 random\nexamples from the training split). The pipelines of different methods are demonstrated in Figure 21. In\nthis experiment, we call the pretrained model B0 (and E0, which is identical to B0), which is an official\ncheckpoint pretrained by J. Bai et al. (2023). Model B1 and E1 are the ones after SFT, which are different for\nthese two methods. Model B2−2/4/6 and E2−2/4/6 are the models finetuned using DPO for 2/4/6 epochs. All\nthe settings (except the starting model) of the DPO stage are the same for these two methods.\n\nu ) and πθt(y−\n\nWe first observe the learning dynamics of these two methods in Figure 5, where all the trends support our\nanalysis quite well. See the first two panels that compare πθt(y+\nu ) respectively. It is clear that\nthese two methods have an almost identical curve on πθt(y+\nu ) in the SFT stage but behave quite differently\non πθt(y−\nu ): because we directly train the model using (x, y−\nu ) in the proposed method. Then, after the SFT\nstage, we conduct DPO using identical settings for these two methods. From the first three panels, we can\nobserve the decay speed of all curves of the proposed method is smaller than its counterpart in the baseline.\nThat is the benefit introduced by “pulling up” the πθ0 (y−\nu ) region before conducting DPO. With this specific\ndesign, the big negative gradients in DPO are imposed on the peaky region (the behavior is like the third panel\nin Figure 19) rather than the valley region (see the fourth panel), hence the squeezing effect is successfully\nrestrained. The results in the last panel of Figure 5 are also a strong verification of the whole picture. During\nthe SFT stage, the observed “argmax-probability” of the proposed method is higher than the baseline, because\n\n39\n\n\fPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2025\n\n(a) Result on Antropic-HH.\n\n(b) Result on UltraFeedback.\n\nFigure 22: Learning dynamics of the baseline and the proposed method with training data extension.

Specifically, we first randomly select 1000 test questions\nfrom the test split of Antropic-HH and generate 1000 responses by feeding the prompts to each of these\nmodels (we use the default sampling setting provided in (Rafailov et al. 2023)). Then, with the prompt\ntemplate provided in Figure 23, we evaluate the win rate of the responses pairs using GPT3.5-Turbo and\nClaude3-Haiku. Here we report the average win rate of different comparisons (the degenerated responses\nare not compared, so the number of compared examples is slightly smaller than 1000). Note that a win rate\ngreater than 0.5 means the method that comes first is preferred by the evaluator.\n\n1. Compare models after SFT: E1 v.s. B1, win rate is 0.4729 and 0.4679;\n2.

Hence we then directly compare the models after DPO in these two methods in the\nthird group. In this group, all models in the proposed method win the baseline counterparts by a large margin,\nwhich demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, we find the evaluation made by\nClaude is more reserved compared with GPT (the numbers are smaller). However, the trends among the\ncomparisons in this group are consistent: E2−4 brings the largest improvement, which is potentially the best\nmodel. This fact is verified in the fourth group comparison, where we evaluate E2−4 against E2−2 and E2−6.\nThe results demonstrate that both a too-long or too-short finetuning stage using DPO is not the best choice.\n\nFigure 23: Prompt used for evaluating model’s response (from (Rafailov et al. 2023)), an example feedback\nfrom GPT3.5-turbo, and two examples of the “degenerate” effect described in Holtzman et al. 2020.\nAlthough both B2 and E2 inevitably generate such degenerate responses, we find this phenomenon is less\ncommon in the proposed method.\n\n41\n\n\f\n</file>\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json\n\n<file path=\"/Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json\">\n[Long Context Document Collection]\nTotal documents: 69\nSample titles: ['高质量数据集典型案例｜中国移动研发大模型高质量数据集-今日头条', '法学教授也能出圈？罗翔的讲课视频在B站一出锅便炸了_澎湃号·媒体_澎湃新闻-The Paper', '大模型Scaling Law深度解析，收藏这篇就够了！-CSDN博客']\n\n**Use RAG tools (rag_search, rag_get_context) to search this document.**\n</file>\n\n\n## Video Files\n\n\nThe following video files are available for analysis:\n\n\n### video.mp4\n\nVideo file: video.mp4\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/video.mp4\nDuration: 1001.33 seconds\nResolution: 640x360\nFPS: 30.0\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Use the 'video_understanding_advanced' tool to analyze these videos.\nRecommendation:\n- Use enable_verification=true for detailed action/scene analysis\n- For quick preview, use 'video_quick_analysis' tool\n- To analyze specific time ranges, use 'video_temporal_qa' with start_time and end_time\n- To extract key moments/frames, use 'video_extract_keyframes' tool\n\n\n## Long Context Documents (RAG)\n\n\nThe following long context document files are available for semantic search:\n\n\n### long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db ⭐ **RECOMMENDED - USE THIS DATABASE**\n\nPath: /Users/apple/Documents/code/MiroThinker-MM/apps/miroflow-agent/datasets/005/long_context_sampled_128k.json.chunks.db\n\nSize: 2696.0 KB\n\n**This is a pre-built embedding database.
