ORIGINAL REPORT (Before Validation)
================================================================================

Transformer123420003000 represents a classical Transformer architecture, as reflected in both foundational texts and advanced research [long_context: "写给“纯小白”的大语言模型入门指南，（非常详细）零基础入门到精通，收藏这一篇就够了-CSDN博客", chunk 2]; [long_context: "Transformer模型PyTorch实现：从原理到代码完全解析-CSDN博客", chunk 1]. The model features encoder and decoder stacks built from repeated layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks (FFN) [long_context: "Transformer模型PyTorch实现：从原理到代码完全解析-CSDN博客", chunk 1], enabling parallel computation, strong long-sequence learning, and high flexibility across NLP and multi-modal tasks [long_context: "为什么Transformer适合做多模态任务？", chunk 2].

LLM finetuning (such as in SFT and DPO pipelines) uses these capabilities for instruction-following and preference alignment. However, cutting-edge research has uncovered intricate learning dynamics: certain strategies like off-policy DPO can harm model alignment by triggering the “squeezing effect.” Here, extreme negative gradients on unlikely responses cause the probability mass to concentrate (become "peaky"), decreasing confidence and diversity in outputs—leading to degeneration, repetition, or hallucination [pdf.pdf, all pages].

No evidence for these advanced dynamics or their mitigation was found in mainstream long-context resources: only the supplied ICLR 2025 conference paper analyzes, proves, and experimentally demonstrates these phenomena. It further shows that a simple, effective solution is to augment SFT with both likely (preferred) and unlikely (rejected) responses before DPO: this prepares the model so that negative gradients in DPO operate in less “valleyed” (unlikely) regions, sharply reducing the squeezing effect and improving post-alignment performance [pdf.pdf, all pages].

In summary, Transformer123420003000 exemplifies high-performance transformer models but, like its real-world peers, greatly benefits from advanced, research-backed refinements to its learning dynamics and alignment pipeline. These state-of-the-art strategies—especially as explained in the ICLR 2025 paper—are necessary to avoid hallucinations and degeneration during finetuning, achieving robust and aligned LLM behavior.
